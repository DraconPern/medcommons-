Order Records From Your Doctor Online or InPerson

Your Doctor Delivers the Records Back to You as a Temporary MedCommons Account via a Voucher InPerson or Online

If Your Doctor Wants to Charge then normal MedCommons Voucher Behavior Applies

If Your Doctor Says Its Free then it is totally free and MedCommons will eat the Amazon Charges

Nothing is ever put directly into the patient's MedCommons Account with a voucher review and copy to healthURL step , 2 extra clicks


There are six cases:

				Doctor is Completely Offline		Doctor Is Online	Doctor is On MOD

Patient is OnLIne		print and carry to doctor		figure out email addr	figure out doctor
                                                the page encourages doctor                 send email with           patient pays and gets electronic voucher, 
                                                tio enroll and make money		enrollment		MOD patientlist is adjusted


Patient Has MedCOmmons	print and carry to doctor		figure out email	same as above
									put something re -->  put something re voucher status on patient's dashboard

The only way to get any payment going here is for the doctor to be on MOD. Otherwise its free.

It doctor isnt on MOD we are just sending the forms to him as email, whether the patient is on MedCommons or not, if he doesnt want to join he can still attach whatever he wants to the email and send it on 
to the patient. The patient can then manually import into her account.

If the doctor is on MOD it is exactly the same as printing the voucher in the office and sending an electronic version  back to the patient. It goes on the PatientList, and that's that until it is marked as completed.

The doctor may require payment in advance before even starting the process We should support this even if online

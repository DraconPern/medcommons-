<h2>Put Your Patient's Data into Their Accounts</h2>
<p>Use all of MedCommons for Your Patient's Benefit:
<ul>
<li>Your Front-Office Team can use HealthFrame to enter Patient Data</li>
<li>If you have a scanner you can use DDL </li>
<li>If you want to review a patient's records use the MedCommons Viewer</li>
<li>If you want to run a DICOM workstation, try Osirix here</li>
<li>Use a toll-free Fax Number to move paper documents into a patient's account</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Remember, Fax and DICOM will cost your patients additional fees, which will be shared between MedCommons and your practice</p>

<h3>ASP Cloud Power</h3>
<p>MedCommons ASP runs as a healthcare application server in your choice of
cloud environments or in your own data centers. It is a complete ASP in
a box, ready to deploy natively at Amazon Web Services or elsewhere
under VMware within minutes. All MedCommons ASP applications offer a
comprehensive health record management platform for use by clinicians,
patients or both. MedCommons ASP supports HIPAA compliant online backup,
multiple availability zones for disaster recovery, and personal account

<h3>ARRA 2009 Privacy and Security Compliance</h3>
<p>Each MedCommons account includes extensive privacy and security features
including authorization to individuals, groups and external applications
as well as Accounting for Disclosures meeting the requirements of ARRA
2009. Other HIPAA and ARRA required features include the
patient-controlled sharing, personal health record feeds and convenient

<h3>Decision Support and Data Mining</h3>
<p>Each MedCommons account has a consent mechanism for specific
individuals, groups and 3rd-party systems. For realtime decision support
the account can be queried online via REST protocols. For deeper
analysis your server can feed directly into 3rd-party cloud-based data
warehouses, column-oriented databases, local SQL and file base
repositories, and the Amazon Map/Reduce infrastructure for data
analysis.</p>

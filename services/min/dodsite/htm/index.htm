<h5>HIPAA</h5>
<div class=hippastuff>MedCommons&#0174; DICOM on Demand service
creates individual private storage accounts (HealthURL) for clinical
information. These accounts can be used by HIPAA covered entities and
business associates to the extent they follow their HIPAA procedures.
These accounts can also be used directly by patients. HealthURL accounts
created from this site are stored by Amazon Inc. Please refer to the
Amazon Web services HIPAA Statement <a
	href='http://awsmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_HIPAA_Whitepaper_Final.pdf'>here</a>.
MedCommons DICOM on Demand services and practices are provided under our
<a href='hipaa_statement.php'>HIPAA Statement</a>, <a
	href='http://www.medcommons.net/termsofuse.php'>Terms of Use</a> and <a
	href='http://www.medcommons.net/privacy.php'>Privacy Policy</a>. The
email address you supply to use DICOM On Demand will be used to notify
you in case we become aware of unauthorized access and otherwise as
required by law. The email address will be available to doctors and
other users when you grant access to the HealthURL.</div>


<div class=hippastuff>To help track access to the HealthURL, the
PIN associated with the HealthURL voucher can be used only once. Upon
first use, it must be replaced by a pssword that is not known to you,
the sender. Continued access to the HealthURL will then be available on
the original computer (unless the access cookie is cleared) used to
upload the information and by using the password set by the recipient
(until the account expires - typically 30 days). MedCommons will log the
IP address and access method (cookie, PIN/Pasword, administrative) for
each account and make this information available as required by law.
Please contact info@medcommons.net in case of problems.</div>

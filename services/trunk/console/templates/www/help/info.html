  <h2>Answers</h2>
  <h3><a name='q1'>Why is MedCommons free?</a></h3>

  <p class='content'>MedCommons offers limited accounts as a service to the community and as an easy and simple way for
  people to try out our products.&nbsp;   MedCommons does not offer support or other services for free accounts.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><a name='q2'>How does MedCommons make money?</a></h3>

  <p class='content'>MedCommons charges for high usage accounts, accounts that
  need FDA compliance, custom and dedicated upload facilities, system
  integration and support.&nbsp;  If you need any of these 
  services, please <a href='mailto:cmo@medcommons.net'>contact us</a>.&nbsp;</p>


  <h3><a name='q8'>What are the benefits of MedCommons?</a></h3>
  <p class='content'>MedCommons allows you to replace fragile and inconvenient use of physical
  media such as CDs with online transfers which are faster, cheaper and safer.&nbsp;  Every healthcare worker is
  familiar with the problems of receiving unreadable, incorrect, or incompatible image data on CD.&nbsp; 
  MedCommons eliminates these problems by allowing senders of imaging data to easily upload it and view it online and ensure 
  correct data is ready for download before the recipient gets it.&nbsp;    Recipients who integrate MedCommons into their 
  PACS can automate image transfer so that images are delivered direct into their systems with no manual intervention.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <h3><a name='q3'>How long do images that I upload stay on MedCommons?</a></h3>

  <p class='content'>By default, images and other documents stay on MedCommons for 30 days.&nbsp;
  If you don't do anything to preserve them, images and documents will be completely erased including backups or
  archived copies after that time.&nbsp;  MedCommons may keep some logs and other data about transfers as part of our 
  obligations under law and to ensure we can provide adequate customer service and support.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><a name='q4'>Can I use MedCommons for diagnosis?</a></h3>

  <p class='content'>
    Radiology diagnosis requires FDA-registered software and display screens of
    adequate quality for the task.&nbsp;
    The free version of MedCommons can be used to transfer and share health
    records, including radiology images but is not labeled for use as a display for
    diagnostic purposes at this time.&nbsp;
    Please contact us for our FDA-registered software and services.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <h3><a name='q5'>Do I need to install anything to use MedCommons?</a></h3>

  <p class='content'>People receiving images do not need to have any software
  installed other than a browser.&nbsp;   The MedCommons online viewer will allow them to view
  or download the images at full fidelity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class='content'>
  MedCommons uses a Java based image upload utility to assist in uploading large image sets.&nbsp;  Most people already
  have Java installed but if not, our web pages will prompt you to install it when it is needed.&nbsp;   The MedCommons upload utility 
  itself is called DDL.&nbsp;   It does not install anything permanently on your
  computer and only needs to run while images are actually uploading.&nbsp;</p>
  </p>

  <h3><a name='q6'>Can I transfer images of my patients using MedCommons?</a></h3>

  <p class='content'>The answer to this question depends on legal obligations that are particular to your situation.&nbsp;
  In the USA, healthcare providers are covered by HIPAA which will not usually allow you to transfer patient data
  unless you have signed a HIPAA business associate agreement with the parties involved, including parties such as MedCommons.&nbsp; 
  For paying customers MedCommons can arrange to 
  sign HIPAA business associate agreements to enable you to use MedCommons.&nbsp;</p>

  <p class='content'>All users are encouraged to carefully consult local laws regarding patient privacy before using MedCommons to transfer
  images of patients.&nbsp;  MedCommons encourages such users to try out our services using free sets of anonymized sample data that 
  can be obtained from the following web site:</p>
  <p class='content'>

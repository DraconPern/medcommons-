				<P><B>2. Use of the Site.</B> You may use the Site, and transmit
				and store data only in accordance with and subject to these Terms
				of Use and the MedCommons Inc. Privacy Policy (the 'Privacy
				Policy') (available at <A HREF="http://www.medcommons.net/">www.medcommons.net</A>).
								</P>
				<P>You understand and agree that MedCommons may stop (permanently
				or temporarily) providing any products, services or features
				offered through the Site at any time. Any data transmitted to the
				Site is subject to deletion without notice at any time. You are
				responsible for maintaining back-up copies of such data

				<P>You understand and agree that you are responsible for
				maintaining the confidentiality of PIN codes, passwords and other
				identifiers associated with your use of the Site (each, a 'Pass
				Code'). Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely
				responsible to MedCommons for any activity that occurs in
				connection with your Pass Codes. Further, you understand and
				agree that MedCommons will not recover any lost Pass Code. 
				</P>
				<P>You may not use the Site for any purpose that is unlawful or
				prohibited by these Terms of Use, or to solicit the performance
				of any illegal activity or other activity which infringes the
				rights of MedCommons or others. Without limiting the foregoing,
				you may not (a) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer any
				software available through the Site, except, and only to the
				extent, as expressly permitted by law or (b) attempt to gain
				unauthorized access to any portion of the Site or any other
				systems or networks connected to the Site by hacking or any other
				illegitimate means. 
				</P>
				<P><B>3. Proprietary Rights.</B> You acknowledge and agree that
				the content and materials available on the Site are protected by
				copyrights, trademarks, service marks or other proprietary rights
				and laws. You agree not to sell, license, rent, modify,
				distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly
				perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from
				content or materials available on the Site. Use of the content or
				materials for any purpose not expressly permitted in these Terms
				of Use is prohibited. 
				</P>
				<P><B>4. Feedback.</B> There may be opportunities within the Site
				for you to provide certain comments, suggestions, data or other
				information to MedCommons (collectively, 'Feedback'). MedCommons
				shall have the right to retain and use any such Feedback in
				current or future products or services, without further
				compensation to you. To the extent such Feedback is protectable
				under intellectual property laws, you agree to cooperate with
				MedCommons as needed to obtain such protection as MedCommons may
				desire and you agree to assign your rights to such Feedback to
				MedCommons. 
				</P>
				<P><B>5. Additional Terms and Conditions. </B>Additional terms
				and conditions may apply to specific portions of the Site, which
				terms are made a part of these Terms of Use by reference. You
				agree to abide by such other terms and conditions. If there is a
				conflict between these Terms of Use and the terms posted for or
				applicable to a specific portion of the Site, the latter terms
				shall control with respect to your use of that portion of the
				Site. 
				</P>
				<P><B>6. International Use</B>. MedCommons makes no
				representation that materials available on the Site are
				appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United
				States, and accessing the Site is prohibited in territories where
				viewing or downloading the Site or the content or materials
				thereon is in violation of local law. Those who choose to access
				the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and
				are responsible for compliance with local laws. 
				</P>
				<P><B>7. Third Party Sites</B>. The Site may link you to other
				web sites on the Internet. These other web sites are not under
				the control of MedCommons, and you acknowledge that MedCommons is
				not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality,
				decency or any other aspect of the content of such sites. The
				inclusion of such a link does not imply endorsement of the site
				by MedCommons or any association with its operators. 
				</P>
				<P><B>8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</B>. ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION
				AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE (THE
				'CONTENT') ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' FOR YOUR USE.
				THE CONTENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER
				EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
				WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
				OR NONINFRINGEMENT. MEDCOMMONS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT
				IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT THE SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE
				AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS
				WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE CONTENT IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR
				OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS SOLELY AT YOUR
				RISK. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OF
				CERTAIN WARRANTIES, THESE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
				</P>
				<P><B>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. </B>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
				SHALL MEDCOMMONS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE,
				INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE
				USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES
				WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
				NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF
				MEDCOMMONS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
				Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
				limitation of incidental or consequential damagers, MedCommons'
				liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to the extent
				permitted by law. <B>You may recover from MedCommons only direct
				damages up to the amount you paid to MedCommons in connection
				with your use of the Site during the twelve (12) months prior </B>to
				the event giving rise to such liability. 
				</P>
				<P><B>10. Release and Waiver</B>. To the maximum extent permitted
				by applicable law, you hereby release, and waive all claims
				against MedCommons and its employees and agents from any and all
				liability for claims, damages (actual and consequential), costs
				and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of
				every kind and nature, arising out of or in any way connected
				with use of the Site. If you are a California resident, you waive
				your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which states, 'A
				general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
				not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
				executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
				affected his settlement with the debtor.' Residents of other
				states and nations similarly waive their rights under applicable
				and/or analogous laws, statutes or regulations. 
				</P>
				<P><B>11. Indemnification.</B>You agree to defend, indemnify and
				hold harmless MedCommons, and its employees, contractors,
				officers and directors from all liabilities, claims and expenses,
				including attorneys' fees, that arise from your use or misuse of
				the Site. MedCommons reserves the right, at it own expense, to
				assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise
				subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will
				cooperate with MedCommons in asserting any available defenses. 
				</P>
				<P><B>12. Termination.</B> MedCommons reserves the right, in its
				sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your access to all or
				part of the Site, with or without notice. 
				</P>
				<P><B>13. Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.</B>
				If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible
				on the Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,
				please provide the following information to MedCommons: 
				</P>
				<UL>
					<LI><P>an electronic or physical signature of the person
					authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright
					interest; 
					</P>
				</UL>
				<UL>
					<LI><P>a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has
					been infringed; 
					</P>
					<LI><P>a description of where the material that you claim is
					infringing is located on the Site; 
					</P>
					<LI><P>your address, telephone number and email address; 
					</P>
					<LI><P>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that
					the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
					agent, or the law; and 
					</P>
					<LI><P>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that
					the above information in your notice is accurate and that you

				<P><B>14. Choice of Law and Forum. </B>These Terms of Use shall
				be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
				Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflicts of law
				rules. You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for
				any claim or action arising out of or relating to these Terms of
				Use or your use of the Site shall be the state or federal courts
				located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and you further
				agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such
				courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or
				action.<BR><BR><B>15. Miscellaneous.</B> Unless otherwise
				specified herein, these Terms of Use, together with the Privacy
				Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and
				MedCommons with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or
				contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral,
				written or electronic) between you and MedCommons with respect to
				the Site. If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or
				unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner
				consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible,
				the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining
				portions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of
				MedCommons to act with respect to a breach by you or others does
				not waive MedCommons' right to act with respect to subsequent or
				similar breaches. MedCommons' failure to exercise or enforce any
				right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a
				waiver of such right or provision. The section headings contained
				in these Terms of Use are included for convenience only and shall
				not limit or otherwise affect the terms of these Terms of Use.</P>

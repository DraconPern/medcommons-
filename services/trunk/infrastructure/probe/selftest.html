<h1>Self-Test My Browser Connection To MedCommons</h1>
<p>This page is for customer use. One purpose is to assist the MedCommons Help Desk to diagnose particular problems with a customer's MedCommons experience. 
</p>
<p>All of these tests put up a little display and recyle various performance numbers as each test is performed</p>
<h2>Loopback Test</h2>
<p>This in and out of the MedCommons appliance as quickly as possible. Look at "Round Trip Time"  to get a feel for the responsiveness of the system. </p>

</ul>
<h2>Upload Tests</h2>
<p>Some of these tests can take a long time. To get a very precise measure, run the "Upload Nothing" test first, and subtract its round-trip time from
the specific upload test result to get the actual time to move the data upstream.</p>

    The Site is a health records platform that allows you and your designated
      sources to collect personal information on your behalf. You can also share
      your personal information with family, friends, and health care
      professionals as well as with separate tools and software applications
      (each, an &quot;Application&quot;) available online. Such Applications might be used
      to collect, edit, process and search for relevant information. 
      <p>
     The Site is organized into Accounts typically representing a single
        individual. An Account contains private information for the purpose of
        identifying the individual (e.g.: name, email address) as well as private
        medical information (e.g.: allergies, medications, diagnoses, lab results,
        hospitals and health history). 
         <p>
      The Site is designed to allow a great deal of control to the patient-owner
        of any private information collected on their behalf. This includes the
        ability for a caregiver to create an Account about you and then transfer
        ownership of the account to you; the ability for you to download
        substantially all documents in your owned account in a convenient format; to
        delete access to others who may have created the Account about you; to
        delete the account contents in part or their entirety. Although we ask for
        personal identifying and contact information in order to provide reliable
        and convenient service, we also allow account owners to be identified
        anonymously and to link their accounts to external and independent
        third-party authentication services. Social networks are an example of such
        a third-party authentication service.

  We collect personal information to identify users and as part of the health records managed by the Site. We use the information that you provide for the following general purposes: 
  <br><br>

  	<ul>
    <li>to fulfill your requests for use of certain features of the Site 
	to contact you 
	<li>to connect your Account on the Site to other external accounts and 
	Applications that you choose 
	<li>to assemble your health record 
	<li>to determine and control who else can access the Account on the Site.</ul>
  
   
   
   <p>
     Information we collect for the purpose of accessing external Applications may include passwords or security tokens that identify you as the authorized user. 
<p>
You can authorize external Applications and other third parties to add, view, modify and/or delete information in the Account. Please refer to the privacy statements of those Applications for information about their privacy policies and how they will use the information they access. 
 <p>
By default, Accounts are controlled by one or more "custodians," initially the user or Application that created the Account. Additional Account custodians may be added to the list of custodians at the time of Account creation or subsequently. Control of an account can be passed from one custodian to another. For example, a doctor can create an account for the purpose of medical referral (in which case, the doctor would be the custodian) and then transfer control of the Account to the patient to use as a personal health record (in which case, the patient would be the custodian). The patient might then choose to assume sole control of the account and revoke or continue access privileges to the original or other doctor(s) as desired. 
<p>Through the Site, we automatically gather certain information about the use of the Site, such as the how frequently certain areas of the Site are visited including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies. We also collect standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit such as browser type, IP address, language, access times and referring Web site address.

    The Site is designed to facilitate disclosure of medical record information under strict control and consent. Sharing of medical information allows care management for a family member or friend, consultation with your health care provider or an independent second-opinion. Disclosure to an external Application allows processing to detect errors or drug interactions and communications with imaging scanners and hospital networks that are otherwise inaccessible from the Internet. 
 <p>
Sharing is controlled by designated Account custodian(s). Access can be granted to users that are authenticated by the Site (and subject to this Site's policies and password check) and to users that are authenticated by third-party sites that are trusted by any custodian of your Account. For example, you may grant access to a user authenticated by an OpenID service provider (e.g.: Verisign PIP) without requiring the user to store a password or other private information on the Site.

    Your account is created by you or a custodian on your behalf and includes personal information owned by you. Proof of ownership of an account at the Site is documented by possession of the Registration Page. Accounts created by a custodian on your behalf can be claimed by their owner with the cooperation of the custodian(s). 
 <p>
Any user or application with Write privilege to the Account will be able to modify and delete information thereby making it inaccessible to others. The Account provides owners a Download All Documents feature that can be used to conveniently create a separate archive outside of the Account. 
 <p>
The owner of an account can modify or delete information in the Account. Modification of digitally signed information may invalidate the digital signature. Deletion of a document or information item may leave a log of the deletion event for security purposes. Custodians of Accounts that are not owned can modify and delete all contents. 
 <p>
The owner of an Account can close their Account. Custodians of accounts that are not owned can also close an Account. Information in an Account that is closed will become inaccessible immediately and will be deleted in 90 days. This time is chosen to minimize the risk of accidental or malicious deletion. Deleted Accounts can may be restorable by contacting the Site support office.

    Accounts on the Site can be created by a custodian authenticated by a third-party unrelated to the operator of the Site. Social networking sites are a common example of a third-party authenticator that may be linked to the Site. This feature enables single sign-on, protects privacy by reducing the amount of personal information the Site must collect, allows for anonymous accounts and makes it convenient for caregivers to create accounts on a person's behalf. Accounts that are created subject to authentication of a third party may be unreachable directly from the Site for purposes of access, update or closure. To enable direct control of an Account in case they lose access to or the cooperation of the third-party authenticator, custodians and owners should establish an email and password at the Site as well as print and keep their Account Recovery Page safely in their files. 
 <p>
The Site reserves the right to deny authentication privileges to a third-party authenticator.

   Any custodian of an Account on the Site may enable access to some or all of the account by other users, groups and applications. Users, groups and applications may be authenticated by the Site or by third-party authenticators acceptable to the custodian or owner of the Account that authorizes the access. The Site does not monitor the credentials or restrict third-party authenticators you authorize for access to your Account. By authorizing access you (or another custodian) are asserting that the person, group or application is able to access the specific Account on the Site that you control as custodian.
 <p>
Groups and applications that are granted access to your account may represent one or more individual users. Group membership or access to the application is beyond the Site's control. DO NOT AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO GROUPS OR APPLICATIONS AS AUTHENTICATED BY THE SITE OR BY A THIRD PARTY AUTHENTICATOR UNLESS YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE PRIVACY POLICY OF THE SITE OR THE THIRD PARTY AUHENTICATOR OR APPLICATION. 
 <p>
The Site may allow sharing of a subset of the account in order to restrict access by different groups and facilitate second opinions. It is your responsibility to understand and configure these restrictions appropriately. 
 <p>
The Site may assign tracking numbers and PIN numbers to some documents. The tracking numbers are not personally-identifiable information and might be transmitted conveniently in email. The PIN may be communicated directly by you or another authorized user of the Account to another user such as over a phone to allow access to the document via the tracking number. Please exercise great caution in using the PIN feature. Once a PIN is disclosed, it is out of your control and may be abused or shared by multiple users without a specific record to document how many different users gained access.

  HOWTO MAKE IT WORK ON CYGWIN
==================================

As outlandish as it might seem, it is possible to do all this rpm stuff under
Windows using Cygwin.    

1. Install rpm and rpmbuild using Cygwin setup.exe

2. Define some environment variables to set where it is going to look for build components

  export IDENTITY_WORK='c:/mc/svn/services/java/identity'
  export CONFIG_WORK=c:/mc/svn/services/config

Notice how the paths are in mixed format (usable by both Windows AND Unix code, this is important).

3. Set up rpm macros in your home directory:

  cat > ~/.rpmmacros
  %_topdir      /sv/forge/rpmbuild
  %_smp_mflags  -j3
  <CTRL-D>

Make sure you set the correct path in there. This sets the root location for rpm and stops it 
trying to write to outlandish parts of the Cygwin file system.

Don't expect these cygwin generated rpms to actually install anywhere (even on Cygwin). This procedure
just lets you work on the specs and verify they are ok by doing builds with them.

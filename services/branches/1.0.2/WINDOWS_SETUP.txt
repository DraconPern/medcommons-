A very terse description of setup on windows:

1. install java

2. install cygwin (inc. svn)

2.1 checkout /services/trunk/php

3. install xampp

  3.1 do an svn checkout to get the PHP code into the xampp htdocs directory
  3.2 because of medcommons deploys the same files to multiple places you need
      to simulate that to make an easy dev environment by creating sym links / junction
      points.  Eg:

      cd c:\xampp\htdocs\mc
      junction.exe  css  c:\xampp\htdocs\mc\site\css
      junction.exe  images c:\xampp\htdocs\mc\site\images

  3.3 Make a directory c:\cygwin\tmp\_php_consumer_test
      Needed for PHP sessions to go into 
  
4. adjust php.ini,  httpd.conf

  4.1 If using xampp 1.7, follow instructions here:  http://www.apachefriends.org/f/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=32617

  4.2 Add mysql databases / users

  generally turns out like this:

   grant all privileges on *.* to 'root'@'yeti' with grant option;

  4.3 Add mysql.internal to hosts file 

5. Run db creation script in 

    https://svn.medcommons.net/svn/services/trunk/schema 

6. install python 2.5 (NOT 2.6)

7. install python mysql support 
   - download exe installer for mysql-python from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python
   - you'll have to dig to find the exe version down the list a bit, make sure you get 2.5 
     version of it
   - note:  on win7 some msvc dependencies are missing.  finding them (anywhere) and copying them
     to c:\windows\SysWOW64 worked to make it run.

8. install fpconst from http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/f/fpconst/fpconst-0.7.2.tar.gz#md5=10ba9e04129af23108d24c22c3a698b1
   use 'python setup.py install' to install

9. install SOAPpy from http://transact.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pywebsvcs/SOAPpy-0.11.6.tar.gz
   NOTE: get .11.6, don't get .12, it's broken in python 2.5, and don't get 0.11.1, it doesn't work with XFire
   use 'python setup.py install' to install

10. Set $GLOBALS['Script_Domain'] = null in urls.inc.php - necessary because by default it's set to your domain, 
    but script domain can't have less than two components to work in javascript.  So if your machine
    is not referenced by fully qualified domain name (eg: localhost, 'foo') it won't work.

11. Now you can publish to get templates.  I set up a sym link to send them to the right
    place.  Install Django. Check out console.

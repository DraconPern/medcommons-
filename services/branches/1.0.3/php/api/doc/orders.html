    <h1><img src='mc_logo.png'/> MedCommons Orders Integration</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>MedCommons can integrate with the ordering systems in external application and web sites
    by using a simple HTML form based interface.  This document briefly describes how to
    set up your order system to automatically send orders to and receive notifications from 
    MedCommons. </p>

    <h2>2. Creating Orders Inside MedCommons</h2>
    <p>The starting point for integrating with the MedCommons order system support
    will usually be via the DICOM Upload Page.  Every group (or practice) within 
    MedCommons has a dedicated upload page (you can find the URL on your Settings page).
    Any time DICOM is uploaded using this page an Order is created within the MedCommons
    system which can be used to track the status and progress of the processing of the image data.</p>
    <p>
    Each order has a unique identifier known as the <i>Callers Order Reference</i>.  
    In the default case, this identifier is automatically generated for you, however 
    if you have such an identifier in your own system then you can pass the order reference
    that you want to use into MedCommons.  To do that, you only need to append a single parameter
    to the DICOM Upload Page for your group.  Here's an example:</p>

    <pre>https://healthurl.medcommons.net/1172619833385984/upload?callers_order_reference=1234567890</pre>

    <p>Note that each order reference must be unique.</p>

    <h2>3. Tracking Orders within MedCommons</h2>
    <p>Once an order is created within MedCommons there are various ways to track it.  The simplest way is that you can query 
       the status via the order status URL.  Such a URL has the following form:</p>

      <pre>https://healthurl.medcommons.net/orders/orderstatus?callers_order_reference=1234567890</pre>

       <p><i>Note that you should be logged into your MedCommons Account for this URL to work.</i></p>

       <p>You can also retrieve this same information in either XML or JSON format if you wish to 
       integrate it with your own systems.  To retrieve in a different format, just add "&amp;fmt=xml" or 
       "&amp;fmt=json" to the end of the URL.  For example:</p>

      <pre>https://healthurl.medcommons.net/orders/orderstatus?callers_order_reference=1234567890&fmt=xml</pre>

     <p>The results returned from the status query show the order status.  This status field reflects various 
     possible states including the those outlined in the table below:

     <table class='api'>
       <thead>
         <tr><th>State</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
         <tr><td>DDL_ORDER_ACCEPTED</td><td>The order has been created but no DICOM is associated with it.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DDL_ORDER_REJECTED</td><td>A problem occurred in initial creation and the order was rejected.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DDL_ORDER_XMITING</td><td>The DICOM for the order is currently being uploaded.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DDL_ORDER_UPLOAD_COMPLETE</td><td>The DICOM for the order has finished uploading.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DDL_ORDER_COMPLETE</td><td>The DICOM for the order has been downloaded by a DDL and forwarded to a PACS or local Workstation</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DDL_ORDER_CANCELLED</td><td>The order was manually cancelled.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DDL_ORDER_ERROR</td><td>An error occurred and the Order has been aborted.</td></tr>
       </tbody>
     </table>
        
          

    <h2>4. Receiving Notifications from MedCommons about Order Changes</h2>
    <p><i><b>Please Note:  this function is not yet available.</b></i></p>
    <p>If you wish, MedCommons can notify you when the status of your order changes.  This is accomplished by adding a parameter to the 
    URL that originally creates the order called "status_callback" and passing to this URL the URL that you want the status to be
    sent to.  For example:</p>

    <pre>https://healthurl.medcommons.net/1172619833385984/upload?callers_order_reference=1234567890&status_callback=http://yourwebsite.com/awebpage.jsp</pre>

    <p>MedCommons will post status updates to the URL you specify whenever the status of the order changes.</p>

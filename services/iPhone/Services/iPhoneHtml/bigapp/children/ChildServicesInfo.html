<h1>Child Safety Service</h1>
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children recommends you have a full and current set of photos of each of your children, set up and ready to go in case of a child safety emergency.
Your photos are securely stored and will be sent to the appropriate agencies upon your exclusive authorization.
<h2>Collect Materials</h2>
<p>Take a separate Photo Set for each of your children. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children recommends refereshing your child's picture every six months.</p>
<p>Add any other documents as additional material in the photo sets.</p>

<h2>Tell Us Which Photos to Use</h2>
<p>You can shoot photos with the BigApple Shooter for multiple purposes. We need to know for each of your children which set of photos  
is the most current photo set you want to present to authorities in the event of a child safety emergency.</p>
<p>You can optionally set a password for the photoset which will be required for emergency access from the web.</p>
</p>
<h2>In Case of Emergency</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&PageId=244">ACT IMMEDIATELY</a></h3>
<p>When you need to release photos of your children for any purpose you can select the "Release Emergency Photos" from the "Services" Menu and we will pass your information according to the NCMEC guidelines.
</p>
<p>If you have lost your phone and need to release your records, you can access and release your child's records from the web if you have associated a password with the photoset.

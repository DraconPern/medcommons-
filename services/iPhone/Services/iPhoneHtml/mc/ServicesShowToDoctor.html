<h1>Showing Photos and Videos To  Your Doctor - Instructions For Use</h1>
The ShootThePatient app can be used either standalone or with MedCommons. 
Using it standalone is a great way to play without messing up your MedCommons account(s).
<p>If you are running in the Simulator you wont be able to use the Camera or Video. Instead, you can pick photos from your photoalbum. To add photos to the photo album,
open the Finder on you Mac, find an interesting image, and drag it on top of the safari icon on the simulator. It will be in your album the next time you open it up.
</p>
<h2>Collect Needed Materials</h2>
<p>After installing the app you can go into System Preferences and turn ON or OFF the Wizard Setting. After you gain experience with the app you may want to turn the wizard off.
</p>
<p>Leave the Appliance URL parameter alone if you are running in standalone mode. Your pictures will be stored on the web and viewable thru the general URL:
http://ci.myhealthespace.com/probe/gallery.php?uid=(iPhone Unique Identifer)
</p>
<p>When running in standalone mode the app will remember where you left off, any photos you had taken but not Uploaded will be restored and that's about it.</p>
<h2>Running With MedCommons</h2>
<p>When invoked by MedCommons via the mcu:// protocol with valid arguments the application behaves differently. (If invoked with bad arguments it runs in standalone mode).
</p>
<ul>
<li>The default values for fields are supplied via the MCU protocol and the retained values are not utilized. </li>
<li>The View Patient button will take you to the patient's MedCommons healthURL.</li>
</ul>

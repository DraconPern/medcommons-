              <p class="TextMain"><a name="_Toc96137560"><strong>1) What is MedCommons? </strong><br>
                    <br>
              </a>MedCommons is a patient-controlled medical data bank. Like any bank, MedCommons depends on the trust of its customers to stay in business. </p>
              <p class="TextMain"><a href="#top">^ top </a></p>
              <p class="TextMain"><a name="_Toc96137434"></a><a name="_Toc96137561"></a><strong>2) Why call MedCommons a bank? </strong><br>
                  <br>
  MedCommons reminds us that there are many valuable uses for private medical data. This data belongs to the patient and only to the patient. It is the patient's choice if and when and how to share this data with physicians, insurance companies and various companies. <br>
  <br>
  A commons is a resource managed in the common interest. Private medical data when properly managed can help to improve health care for all by facilitating scientific research, objectively demonstrating quality and by promoting public health and safety. </p>
              <p class="TextMain">In the movie " It's a Wonderful Life", Jimmy Stewart teaches us about the value of banks to the community and the importance of voluntary participation in the bank as foundation for trust. </p>

              <p class="TextMain"><a name="_Toc96137562"></a><a name="_Toc96137435"></a><strong>3) Will my physicians accept and use MedCommons? </strong><br>
                  <br>
  MedCommons is based on the physician's own Continuity of Care Record standard. In the words of the ASTM standards organization:"The CCR, or Continuity of Care Record, is a standard specification that has been developed over the past two years jointly by ASTM International, the Massachusetts Medical Society (MMS), the Health Information Management and Systems Society (HIMSS), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association (AMA), the Patient Safety Institute, the American Health Care Association, the National Association for the Support of Long Term Care, and the Mobile Healthcare Alliance. The remarkable success in achieving widespread consensus and early sponsorship of the professional societies and organizations listed above (others are pending) is a testimony to the power and the timing of the concepts and the methodology supporting the CCR. This new specification is intended to foster and improve continuity of patient care, to reduce medical errors, and to assure at least a minimum standard of health information transportability when a patient is referred or transferred to, or is otherwise seen by, another provider". </p>

                  <br>
  MedCommons is a strong supporter of Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise and is a participant in this year's IHE Cross-Enterprise Showcase. The IHE process, manages a series of Profiles representing "best practices" for integration within enterprises. <br>
  <br>
  MedCommons is certified by IHE as meeting the relevant IHE ITI &shy;XDS Profiles. Furthermore, MedCommons will release any of its software hosted by the enterprise under an OSI-certified Open Source license that enables everyone including providers and vendors to review, use, modify and embed the key components of IHE for free. <br>
  <br>
  Relevant components of the MedCommons Gateway to the enterprise have already received clearance by the FDA. </p>
              <p class="TextMain"><a href="#top">^ top </a></p>
              <p class="TextMain"><a name="_Toc96137564"></a><a name="_Toc96137437"></a><strong>5) How will MedCommons make money? </strong><br>
  MedCommons will provide eReferral transfer services and private medical data banking services to patients and their physicians. <br>
  <br>
  MedCommons is free during the initial testing period. Even so, patient privacy and security is being maintained as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-191 ("HIPAA"). <a name="_Toc96137438"></a></p>

              <p class="TextMain"><a name="_Toc96137565"></a><strong>6) Referrals usually take days and cost plenty as I chase around town looking for films. Will MedCommons handle medical images such as CT and MR scans? </strong><br>
                  <br>
  Yes. <br>
  <br>
  MedCommons uses the CCR to organize referrals and links diagnostic-quality radiology images to the appropriate components of the CCR. </p>
              <p class="TextMain"><a href="#top">^ top </a><br>
                  <strong><br>
                  </strong><a name="_Toc96137566"></a><a name="_Toc96137439"></a><strong>7) CCRs and diagnostic radiology images sound like complicated and expensive technology. What will patients and physicians need to install on their computers? </strong><br>
                  <br>
  In most cases, nothing at all. MedCommons is securely accessible to physicians and patients alike via modern Web browsers and email. This includes the ability to create and modify CCRs , and attach scanned documents in PDF format.</p>
              <p class="TextMain">Electronic health record systems are not required for access to MedCommons. Those EHR systems that import and export CCR files will be able to send and receive them directly to and from any patient or physician MedCommons account with MedCommons management of patient consent and HIPAA mandated procedures.</p>
              <p class="TextMain">Simple, user-installed Web browser plugins and open-source gateways will support DICOM attachments, radiologist workstations and PACS interfaces.</p>
              <p class="TextMain">  The MedCommons Gateway is FDA-registered Free/ Open Source Software and will be available for free download once our pilot testing is complete. FDA 510[k] mmary is here. </p>

  MedCommons is being offered as an open and standards-based solution to the patient-control component of the NHIN. We intend to work with Regional Health Information Organizations and other pilot programs as the NHIN takes shape. </p>
              <p class="TextMain"><a href="#top">^ top </a><br>

                  </strong><a name="_Toc96137568"></a><a name="_Toc96137441"></a><strong>9) What is the relationship between MedCommons and proposed HSA (Heath Savings Accounts) and other consumer-directed care insurance programs? </strong><br>
                  <br>
  MedCommons is independent of both health care and insurance providers. By providing true portability and world-wide access to health resources, MedCommons is well suited to consumer-directed insurance plans and may be offered as a convenient link to consumer-controlled health savings account payment cards. </p>
              <p class="TextMain"><a href="#top">^ top </a><strong><br>

  Only if you choose to allow it and to the extent required by law. MedCommons will make it easy to make selective copies of your private data and transfer those copies to physicians, family members and other people as you see fit. In case none of your selected proxies are available, future releases of MedCommons will support access by emergency personnel to a pre-approved, limited subset of your personal health record based on a wallet card or USB memory stick.</p>

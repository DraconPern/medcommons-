The open-source model is a good way to produce software, as the example

medical research too?</b></font><br>



<!--back--><p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">CAN
goodwill, aggregated over the internet, produce good medicine? The
current approach to drug discovery works up to a point, but it is far
from perfect. It is costly to develop medicines and get regulatory
approval. The patent system can foreclose new uses or enhancements by
outside researchers. And there has to be a consumer willing (or able)
to pay for the resulting drugs, in order to justify the cost of drug
development. Pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to develop
treatments for diseases that particularly afflict the poor, for
example, since the people who need such treatments most may not be able
to afford them.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">It is in this
environment that a number of medical biologists, lawyers, entrepreneurs
and health-care activists have sought improvements. They have suggested
borrowing the &#8220;open-source&#8221; approach that has proven so successful in
another area of technology, namely software development. This is a
decentralised form of production in which the underlying programming
instructions, or &#8220;source code&#8221;, for a given piece of software are made
freely available. Anyone can look at it, modify it, or improve it,
provided they agree to share their modifications under the same terms.
Volunteers collaborating in this way over the internet have produced
some impressive software: the best-known example is the Linux operating
system. So why not apply the open-source model to drug development too?</font></p>
<br><div><font face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><b><a name="source_for_the_goose">Source for the goose</a></b></font></div><cf_floatingcontent></cf_floatingcontent>
<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">In fact,
open-source approaches have emerged in biotechnology already. The
international effort to sequence the human genome, for instance,
resembled an open-source initiative. It placed all the resulting data
into the public domain rather than allow any participant to patent any
of the results. Open source is also flourishing in bioinformatics, the
field in which biology meets information technology. This involves
performing biological research using supercomputers rather than
test-tubes. Within the bioinformatics community, software code and
databases are often swapped on &#8220;you share, I share&#8221; terms, for the
greater good of all. Evidently the open-source approach works in
biological-research tools and pre-competitive platform technologies.
The question now is whether it will work further downstream, closer to
the patient, where the development costs are greater and the potential
benefits more direct.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Open-source
research could indeed, it seems, open up two areas in particular. The
first is that of non-patentable compounds and drugs whose patents have
expired. These receive very little attention from researchers, because
there would be no way to protect (and so profit from) any discovery
that was made about their effectiveness. To give an oft-quoted example,
if aspirin cured cancer, no company would bother to do the trials to
prove it, or go through the rigmarole of regulatory approval, since it
could not patent the discovery. (In fact, it might be possible to apply
for a process patent that covers a new method of treatment, but the
broader point still stands.) Lots of potentially useful drugs could be
sitting under researchers' noses.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">The second
area where open source might be able to help would be in developing
treatments for diseases that afflict small numbers of people, such as
Parkinson's disease, or are found mainly in poor countries, such as
malaria. In such cases, there simply is not a large enough market of
paying customers to justify the enormous expense of developing a new
drug. America's Orphan Drug Act, which provides financial incentives to
develop drugs for small numbers of patients, is one approach. But there
is still plenty of room for improvement&#8212;which is where the open-source
approach might have a valuable role to play.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">In a paper presented this week in San Francisco at <font size="-1">BIO </font>2004,
the Biotechnology Industry Organisation's annual conference, Stephen
Maurer, Arti Rai and Andrej Sali&#8212;two lawyers and a computational
biologist, respectively&#8212;called for an open-source approach to invent
drugs to fight tropical diseases. It would work like this: a website
they call the Tropical Disease Initiative would allow biologists and
chemists to volunteer their expertise on certain areas of a specific
disease. They would examine and annotate shared databases, and perform
experiments. The results would be fully transparent and discussed in
chat rooms. The authors expect that the research, at least initially,
would be mainly computational, not carried out in &#8220;wet&#8221; laboratories.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">The
difference between this proposal and earlier open-source approaches in
biomedical research is that where before scientists swapped software,
here they would collaborate on the data. And where projects such as the
mapping of the human genome relied on massive top-down government
involvement, this proposal would, like an open-source software project,
be the result of bottom-up self-organisation among researchers
themselves. That said, the authors acknowledge that a government or
grant-giving charity would probably have to provide the initial funds.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Moreover, the
results of the research would not be made available under an
open-source licence of the kind that governs software projects.
Instead, the final development of drug candidates would be awarded to a
laboratory based on competitive bids. The drug itself would go in the
public domain, for generic manufacturers to produce. This, the authors
state, would achieve the goal of getting new medicines to those who
need them, at the lowest possible price. &#8220;We are so used to patents
that we forgot ways to discover drugs in the public domain, and we need
to rediscover them,&#8221; says Mr Maurer, of the Goldman School of Public
Policy at the University of California in Berkeley.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">This is just
one of many attempts to extend elements of the open-source
software-development model to drug research. Yochai Benkler, a law
professor at Yale, imagines test-tube and animal studies organised in
this manner, exploiting the &#8220;excess capacity&#8221; of graduate students and
university labs, much as students and academics also contribute to
open-source software development.</font></p>
<br><div><font face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><b><a name="trial_and_error">Trial and error</a></b></font></div>
<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Eric von
Hippel, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Sloan School of Management, is investigating how secondary uses for
drugs are discovered, with a view to harnessing doctors and patients to
record data. Many medications are approved for one purpose, but are
regularly prescribed for another, &#8220;off-label&#8221; use. In many instances,
new uses for a drug are discovered only after it is on the market, when
a sort of natural experimentation takes place. For instance, Botox was
approved in America for treating eye-muscle disorders, and only later
found to remove wrinkles. In Europe and America, as many as half of all
drug prescriptions for certain diseases fall into this category. The
drugs often do not go through the formal process for other uses because
the cost of regulatory approval is so high. </font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">This is a
problem for a number of reasons. First, it means that drug companies
are prohibited from advertising the medications based on these
additional uses, so some patients may not get the treatment that would
benefit them. Next, insurance companies in America usually only cover
on-label use. And the effectiveness of the treatment is not formally
evaluated. Dr von Hippel's idea is to decentralise the process of
obtaining data on the off-label use, by collaborating with volunteer
doctors and patients. By defraying costs in this way, it might then be
possible to obtain regulatory approval. It is, in effect, an
open-source clinical trial. Because the drug has already been approved,
it has passed first-phase tests for safety. These do not have to be
repeated. Second and third-phase drug-approvals test for efficacy and
side-effects&#8212;and these are the very areas where getting formal approval
for off-label use is sensible.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Meanwhile, not far from Dr von Hippel at <font size="-1">MIT</font>,
thousands of fruit flies are being decapitated. Peter Lansbury, the
head of a research lab at Harvard Medical School, avows that they are
treated with chloroform, so &#8220;they don't feel a thing&#8221;. The fruit flies
have Parkinson's disease, and Dr Lansbury's research is examining the
therapeutic effect of a thousand approved drugs, on which the patent
has expired in most cases. Might one of them turn out to be an
effective treatment?</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">This sort of
research is unusual because there is no working hypothesis to prove and
no way to profit if the project is successful. It has simply never been
studied before, and should be, says Dr Lansbury, who is the co-founder
of the Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration. The
laboratory has around 25 researchers and an annual budget of $2.5m to
work on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's or
Huntington's, to which the major commercial drug companies devote few
resources because their potential market is small.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Dr Lansbury
refers to the work as &#8220;not-for-profit drug discovery&#8221;, but he sees
direct parallels with the open-source approach. For one thing, his
group places much of its data in the public domain. Secondly, though
the research is mainly happening among different research labs within
the confines of Harvard at the moment, the goal is to involve other
scientists around the world. Only through this sort of collaborative,
distributed approach will treatments be found for these diseases, he
says. As for the intellectual property that may be created, the goal is
to use patents only to license treatments cheaply to pharmaceutical
companies to ensure a supply of drugs at low cost. But the most
important thing is to discover the drugs in the first place&#8212;something
commercial drug-development seems unable to do.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">There are a
number of other similarities between biomedical research and
open-source software development. First, both fields attract the same
sort of people. Biology, like software, relies on teams of volunteers,
notably graduate students and young professionals, who have an
incentive to get involved because it will enhance their professional
reputations or establish expertise. Both medical biologists and
computer scientists aim to improve people's lives and make the world a
better place. And as the human-genome project showed, both cultures
respond strongly to grand projects, not just financial
incentives&#8212;possibly because they are generally highly paid to begin
with.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">That said,
the dissimilarities are profound. The financial needs and time to
complete projects are wildly different. A new piece of software can be
thrown together in days or weeks, and rarely more than a few months.
The barriers to entry are low: many pieces of software begin life in an
enthusiast's bedroom or garage. Pharmaceutical research, in contrast,
is measured in years, fails more often than it succeeds, and requires
hard-core credentials and in many cases expensive equipment, not just
hard work.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Moreover, the
computational portion of the drug-discovery process&#8212;typified as
upstream, far from the patient, at the early-stage level, where profits
are thinner&#8212;is not the costly bit. Rather, it is the less
computer-intensive things such as toiling in wet laboratories,
performing clinical trials and navigating the regulatory-approval
process where one finds the bulk of the cost of bringing a drug to
market. The closer to the patient one goes, the tougher it is to
imagine open-source processes making a significant impact.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">The
application of the open-source approach to drug development may prove
to be more useful as an analogy than an application, notes Janet Hope,
a lawyer completing a doctorate on &#8220;open-source biotechnology&#8221; at the
Australian National University, in Canberra. One reason is that
different intellectual property rights apply, and are protected
differently. Software usually falls under copyright, which arises
automatically and without cost to the author. Biomedical discoveries
are generally protected by an entirely different legal regime, patents,
which are costly to obtain.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">This helps
explain why the drug-discovery and development projects place their
work in the public domain, rather than trying to enforce some form of
reciprocal openness through an open-source licensing agreement, as
software does. Those involved in the human-genome project investigated
the possibility in 2000 of applying an open-source licensing agreement
to the results, but decided that simply throwing the results into the
public domain&#8212;without any restriction on their use&#8212;was better. Its
successor project, the International HapMap Project, which is mapping
the common patterns of variation within the genome, imposes an
open-source licence for research in progress. But it places the
completed data in the public domain and allows patents on subsequent
discoveries. </font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">This suggests
that continued reciprocal sharing, a key part of open-source software
development, may not have a meaningful equivalent on the biological
side of the fence. With open-source drug discovery in the public
domain, where there is no legal obligation to share one's inventions,
there is no guarantee that philanthropic sentiments will override
self-interest. Participants can always choose to send their results to
the patent office rather than the communal web site. While the
open-source approach shows much promise in drug discovery, it is
certainly no panacea.</font></p>
<br><div><font face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><b><a name="back_to_the_source">Back to the source</a></b></font></div>
<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">More broadly,
two big questions remain unanswered as the open-source approach starts
to colonise disciplines beyond its home ground of software development.
The first is whether open-source methods can genuinely foster
innovation. In software, all that has been developed are functional
equivalents of proprietary software&#8212;operating systems, databases, and
so on&#8212;that are sometimes slightly better and sometimes glaringly worse
than their proprietary counterparts. Their main distinction, from
users' point of view, is simply that they are available free of charge.
Curiously, this matches the complaint levelled against pharmaceutical
companies for developing &#8220;me-too&#8221; drugs to compete with other firms'
most successful product lines&#8212;witness the current crop of Viagra
imitators&#8212;rather than spending their research money in an entirely new
area.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">The second
question is semantic. What does it mean to apply the term &#8220;open source&#8221;
in fields outside software development, which do not use &#8220;source code&#8221;
as a term of art? Depending on the field in question, the analogy with
source code may not always be appropriate. It seems the time has come
to devise a new, broader term than &#8220;open source&#8221;, to refer to
distributed, internet-based collaboration. Mr Benkler calls it
non-proprietary peer-production of information-embedding goods. Surely
someone, somewhere can propose something snappier.</font></p>

      <h3>HHS LAUNCHES NEW EFFORTS TO PROMOTE PAPERLESS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM</h3>

<p>HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson today announced two new steps in
building a national electronic health care system that will allow
patients and their doctors to access their complete medical records
anytime and anywhere they are needed, leading to reduced medical
errors, improved patient care, and reduced health care costs. </p>
<p>First, the Secretary announced that the Department has signed an
agreement with the College of American Pathologists (CAP) to license
the College's standardized medical vocabulary system and make it
available without charge throughout the U.S. This action opens the door
to establishing a common medical language as a key element in building
a unified electronic medical records system in the U.S. </p>
<p>Secondly, the Secretary announced that HHS has commissioned the
Institute of Medicine to design a standardized model of an electronic
health record. The health care standards development organization known
as HL7 has been asked to evaluate the model once it has been designed.
HHS will share the standardized model record at no cost with all
components of the U.S. health care system. The Department expects to
have a model record ready in 2004.</p>
<p>Today's announcements are part of the ongoing HHS effort to develop
the National Health Information Infrastructure by encouraging and
facilitating the widespread use of modern information technology to
improve the nation's health care system.</p>
<p>"Banks and other financial institutions all across the country can
talk to each other electronically, which has streamlined customer
transactions and reduced errors," Secretary Thompson said. "We want to
do the same thing for the American health care system. We want to build
a standardized platform on which physicians' offices, insurance
companies, hospitals and others can all communicate electronically,
which will improve patient care while reducing the medical errors and
the high costs plaguing our health care system."</p>
<p>With terms for more than 340,000 medical concepts, the College's
standardized system has been recognized as the world's most
comprehensive clinical terminology database available. The licensing
agreement with the CAP will make it possible for health care providers,
hospitals, insurance companies, public health departments, medical
research facilities and others to easily incorporate this uniform
terminology system into their information systems.</p>
<p>"This system will prove invaluable in facilitating the automated
exchange of clinical information needed to protect patient safety,
detect emerging public health threats, better coordinate patient care
and compile research data for patients participating in clinical
trials," Secretary Thompson said. </p>
<p>The CAP agreement announced today will be administered through the
National Library of Medicine (NLM), a component of HHS' National
Institutes of Health (NIH). NLM has issued a 5-year, $32.4 million
contract to the College for a permanent license for their terminology,
known as SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine) Clinical Terms.
The licensing agreement includes the core database in both English and
Spanish along with regular updates. The terms of the contract include a
one-time payment-shared by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the
Department of Defense, and many HHS agencies-with annual update fees to
be borne by the NLM.</p>
<p>"Today we take a bold step by making SNOMED available, a critical
step in adopting health information standards across the federal
government," Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi said.
"Putting health information standards in the public domain and promptly
adopting health information standards for the federal health partners,
is the 'tipping point' for national standards that strengthen our
electronic health record systems, help optimize our health care, and,
most importantly, improve the health of veterans as well as all of the
people of the U.S."</p>
<p>"The Department of Defense is pleased to have contributed to the
government-wide effort to license SNOMED. This effort will enable us to
better share health information within the Federal government and
beyond. I am delighted with our Federal partnership in this important
step toward improving health care for all Americans," said Dr.
Winkenwerder, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.</p>
<p>"This license validates the College's longstanding support for the
development of medical standards like SNOMED to further improve the
quality of health care. It ensures that government and the private
sector entities in the U.S. will be able to use a common approach to
clinical coding, making it easier to coordinate care and exchange
needed information," said Paul A. Raslavicus, MD, president of the CAP.</p>
<p>The contract between NLM and the College of American Pathologists
comes after three years of negotiations. The effort was supported by
all the agencies participating in the Consolidated Health Informatics
initiative (CHI), which is working to adopt government-wide standards
for clinical health data. CHI is the health care component of President
Bush's eGov Initiatives, created under the President's Management
Agenda, to make it easier for citizens and businesses to interact with
the government, save taxpayer dollars and streamline
citizen-to-government transactions. More information on CHI and the
President's eGov Initiatives may be found at <a href="http://www.egov.gov/">http://www.egov.gov</a>.</p>
<p>NLM will distribute SNOMED through its Unified Medical Language
System, which incorporates, links, and distributes in a common format
100 different biomedical and health vocabularies and classifications.
Details of the SNOMED license arrangement as well as information on
obtaining access to the SNOMED database may be found at: <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_announcement.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_announcement.html</a>. </p>

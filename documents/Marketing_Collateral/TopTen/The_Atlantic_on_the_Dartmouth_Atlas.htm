mericans enjoy the most sophisticated medical care that money can
buy&#8212;and one of the most vexing health-care-delivery systems. We spend
about $1.2 trillion each year, two to four times per capita what other
developed nations spend, yet we can't find a way to provide health
insurance for 41 million citizens. After a brief respite in the 1990s
when HMOs held down expenses by squeezing profits from doctors and
hospitals, medical costs are once again soaring by 10 to 12 percent a
year. Yet reforms proposed by Congress and the White House are only
nibbling around the edges of the problem. <br><br>

Such political timidity is understandable, given the experience of
would-be reformers of the past. Any attempt to expand coverage for the
uninsured while holding down costs inevitably raises fear in the minds
of voters that the only way to accomplish these seemingly opposing
goals is by restricting access to expensive, life-saving medical
treatment. Sure, we feel bad about the 18,000 or so of our fellow
citizens who die prematurely each year because they lack health
insurance, and about the seniors who are forced to choose between
buying food and buying medicine. But Americans want nothing to do with
a system like England's, which, for example, is reluctant to provide
dialysis to the elderly, and most of us who are now covered by either
Medicare or private insurance have little stomach for health-care
reform that contains even a whiff of rationing. <br><br>
Behind this fear lies an implicit assumption that more health care
means better health. But what if that assumption is wrong? In fact,
what if more medicine can sometimes be bad not just for our pocketbooks
but also for our health? <br><br>
An increasing body of evidence points to precisely that conclusion.
"There is a certain level of care that helps you live as long and as
well as possible," says John Wennberg, the director of the <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ececs/">Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences</a>
at Dartmouth Medical School. "Then there's excess care, which not only
doesn't help you live longer but may shorten your life or make it
worse. Many Americans are getting excess care." According to the
center, 20 to 30 percent of health-care spending goes for procedures,
office visits, drugs, hospitalization, and treatments that do
absolutely nothing to improve the quality or increase the length of our
lives. At the same time, the type of treatment that offers clear
benefits is not reaching many Americans, even those who are insured. <br><br>
That's a sobering thought, but it opens the possibility of a new way to
look at the conundrum of health-care reform. Lawmakers, insurers, and
the health-care industry might be able to save money if they were to
concentrate on improving the quality of medicine rather than on
controlling costs. Better health care will of course mean more medicine
for some Americans, particularly the uninsured; but for many of us it
will mean less medicine. <br><br>

Support for this idea can be found in <i><a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1556482574/theatlanticmonthA/">The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care</a></i>,
a compendium of statistics and patterns of medical spending in 306
regions of the country. The atlas is generated by a group of nearly two
dozen doctors, epidemiologists, and health-care economists, using data
from Medicare, large private insurers, and a variety of other sources.
Wennberg is the group's leader and the patron saint of the idea that
more medicine does not necessarily mean better health&#8212;a view that has
not exactly endeared him to the medical establishment over the years.
These days, however, his ideas are bolstered by the <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.iom.edu/">Institute of Medicine</a>
and other independent researchers, and by new results coming from his
Dartmouth research team, which is showing precisely how the nation
misspends its health-care dollars. <br><br>
Take the regions surrounding Miami and Minneapolis, which represent the
high and low ends, respectively, of Medicare spending. A
sixty-five-year-old in Miami will typically account for $50,000 more in
Medicare expenses over the rest of his life than a sixty-five-year-old
in Minneapolis. During the last six months of life, a period that
usually accounts for more than 20 percent of a patient's total Medicare
expend-itures, a Miamian spends, on average, twice as many days in the
hospital as his counterpart in Minneapolis, and is twice as likely to
see the inside of an intensive-care unit. <br><br>
This type of regional variation would make perfect sense if regions
where citizens were sickest were the ones that used the most medical
services. After all, it's only fair that we should spend more and do
more in places where people need more medical attention. But, as
Wennberg and his colleagues Elliott Fisher and Jonathan Skinner point
out in a recent paper, <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.chelationtherapyonline.com/articles/p119.htm">"Geography and the Debate Over Medicare Reform,"</a> which appeared online in the journal <i>Health Affairs</i>,
rates of underlying illness do not account for the differences in
spending among regions. If they did, the region around Provo, Utah, one
of the healthiest in the country, would get 14 percent fewer Medicare
dollars than the national average, because its citizens are less likely
to smoke, drink, or suffer from strokes, heart attacks, and other
ailments. Instead it receives seven percent more than the national
average. In contrast, el-derly people in the region around Richmond,
Virginia, tend to be sicker than the average American, and should be
receiving 11 percent more&#8212;rather than 21 percent less&#8212;than the national
average. Nor are regional differences explained by variations in the
cost of care. Provo doctors are not, for example, charging
significantly more for office visits or lumpectomies than doctors in
Richmond, and their patients aren't getting costlier artificial hips. <br><br>
Rather, much of the variation among regions&#8212;about 41 percent of it, by
the most recent estimate&#8212;is driven by hospital resources and numbers of
doctors. In other words, it is the supply of medical services rather
than the demand for them that determines the amount of care delivered.
Where neonatal intensive-care units are more abundant, more babies
spend more days in the NICU. Where there are more MRI machines, people
get more diagnostic tests; where there are more specialty practices,
people see more specialists. It's probably safe to assume that many
people are gravely ill during the last six months of their lives no
matter where they live; but Medicare beneficiaries see, on average,
twenty-five specialists in a year in Miami versus two in Mason City,
Iowa, largely because Miami is home to a lot more specialists. <br><br>
It would be one thing if all this lavish medical attention were helping
people in high-cost regions like Miami to live longer or better. But
that doesn't appear to be the case. Recent studies are beginning to
show that excess spending in high-cost regions does not buy citizens
better health. Medicare patients visit doctors more frequently in
high-cost regions, to be sure, but they are no more likely than
citizens in low-cost regions to receive preventive care such as flu
shots or careful monitoring of their diabetes, and they don't live any
longer. In fact, their lives may be slightly shorter. The most likely
explanation for the increased mortality seen in high-cost regions is
that elderly people who live there spend more time in hospitals than do
citizens in low-cost regions, Wennberg says, "and we know that
hospitals are risky places." Patients who are hospitalized run the risk
of suffering from medical errors or drug interactions, receiving the
wrong drug, getting an infection, or being subjected to diagnostic
testing that leads to unnecessary treatment. <br><br>
An obvious way we might cut excess medical care is to change the way we
pay hospitals and doctors. "Medicine is the only industry where high
quality is reimbursed no better than low quality," says David Cutler, a
health economist at Harvard. "The reason we do all the wasteful stuff
is that we pay for what's done, not what's accomplished." Although
that's clearly the case, figuring out the right incentives for
health-care providers is by no means easy. Let's say that Medicare
decided to use low-cost regions as a benchmark and told providers in
the rest of the country that their compensation would be capped at some
level not far above the benchmark. Some doctors in high-cost regions
would undoubtedly be encouraged to practice more conservatively, but
many others would maintain their incomes by either dropping Medicare
patients altogether or giving them even more hysterectomies and CT
scans they don't need (thus compensating for lower fees by simply
performing a greater number of procedures). <br><br>
Even if policymakers come up with the right financial incentives,
restructuring compensation will constitute only one small component of
the reform that's needed to turn medicine into an efficient, effective
industry. Think of it this way: at 13 to 14 percent of GDP, health care
is the nation's largest single industry, and probably its most complex.
Transforming this sprawling behemoth is going to involve a lot more
upheaval than, say, the shift that took place in the auto industry when
companies adopted the assembly line, or the shake-up that Hollywood and
the music industry now face with the advent of Web entertainment. <br><br>
Step No. 1 toward improving the quality of health care is reducing what
the Dartmouth group calls "supply-sensitive" care&#8212;the excess
procedures, hospital admissions, and doctor visits that are driven by
the supply of doctors and hospital resources rather than by need.
Organizations such as the <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.ama-assn.org/">American Medical Association</a> and <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.kaiserpermanente.org/">Kaiser Permanente</a>
will need to set standards for more-conservative practices, and for
measuring patient outcomes. Benchmarks are also needed to ensure that
doctors deliver more "evidence-based" medicine: procedures and
practices whose benefits are proven. Three recent studies, conducted by
the Institute of Medicine, the <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.rand.org/">Rand Corporation</a>, and the <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.hcqualitycommission.gov/">President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry</a>,
report widespread underuse of evidence-based treatment, such as balloon
angioplasty to open blocked arteries in heart-attack victims, even
among citizens with gold-plated health insurance. <br><br>
Probably the hardest part of reforming health care will be persuading
policymakers and politicians that improving the quality of care can
also save money. The Medical Quality Improvement Act, introduced last
July by Vermont Senator James Jeffords, is a step in the right
direction. It would call on several medical centers around the country
to model high-quality medicine that also reins in costs. <br><br>

But evidence already exists that improving quality can hold down costs. <a class="magbodylink" target="outlink" href="http://www.franklinhealth.com/">Franklin Health</a>,
a company based in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, manages so-called
"complex cases" for private insurers. Complex cases are the sickest of
the sick, patients with multiple or terminal illnesses, who are also
the most costly to treat. They typically make up only one or two
percent of the average patient population while accounting for 30
percent of costs. Franklin employs a battalion of nurses, who make home
visits and spend hours on the phone, sometimes every day, to help
patients control pain and other symptoms and stay out of the hospital.
For this low-tech but intensive service the company charges insurers an
average of $6,000 to $8,000 per patient&#8212;but it saves them $14,000 to
$18,000 per patient in medical bills. <br><br>
How much money is at stake? If spending in high-cost regions could
somehow be brought in line with spending in low-cost regions, Medicare
alone could save on the order of 29 percent, or $59 billion a
year&#8212;enough to keep the Medicare system afloat for an additional ten
years, or to fund a generous prescription-drug benefit for seniors. And
there's no reason to believe that doctors and hospitals behave any
differently toward their non-Medicare patients. That means the system
as a whole is wasting about $400 billion a year&#8212;more than enough to

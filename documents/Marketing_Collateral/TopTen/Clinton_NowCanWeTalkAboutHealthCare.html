<h3 class="title">Now Can We Talk About Health Care?</h3>

<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES Magazine April 18, 2004 By HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON</p>

<p>I know what you're thinking. Hillary Clinton and health care? Been there. Didn't do that!</p>

<p>No, it's not 1994; it's 2004. And believe it or not, we have more
problems today than we had back then. Issues like soaring health costs
and millions of uninsured have yet to fix themselves. And now we are
confronting a new set of challenges associated with the arrival of the
information age, the technological revolution and modern life.</p>

<a name="more"></a>
<p>Think for a moment about recent advances in genetic testing. Knowing
you are prone to cancer or heart disease or Lou Gehrig's disease may
give you a fighting chance. But just try, with that information in
hand, to get health insurance in a system without strong protections
against discrimination for pre-existing or genetic conditions. Each
vaunted scientific breakthrough brings with it new challenges to our
health system. But it's not only medicine that is changing. So, too,
are the economy, our personal behaviors and our environment. Unless
Americans across the political spectrum come together to change our
health care system, that system, already buckling under the pressures
of today, will collapse with the problems of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Twenty-first-century problems, like genetic mapping, an aging
population and globalization, are combining with old problems like
skyrocketing costs and skyrocketing numbers of uninsured, to overwhelm
the 20th-century system we have inherited.</p>

<p>The way we finance care is so seriously flawed that if we fail to
fix it, we face a fiscal disaster that will not only deny quality
health care to the uninsured and underinsured but also undermine the
capacity of the system to care for even the well insured. For example,
if a hospital's trauma center is closed or so crowded that it cannot
take any more patients, your insurance card won't help much if you're
the one in the freeway accident.</p>

<p>Let's face it -- if we were to start from scratch, none of us, from
dyed-in-the-wool liberals to rock-solid conservatives, would fashion
the kind of health care system America has inherited. So why should we
carry the problems of this system into the future? </p>

<p>21st-Century Problems <br>
At the dawn of the last century, America was coping with the effects of
the industrial revolution -- crowded living conditions, dangerous
workplaces, inadequate sanitation and infrastructure in cities and
pollution and infectious diseases like typhoid fever and cholera that
exacted a huge toll on the oldest and youngest in society.</p>

<p>Since then, a century's worth of advances yielded remarkable
results. Antibiotics were developed. Anesthesia was improved. Public
health programs like mosquito control and childhood immunizations
succeeded in reducing or even eradicating diseases like malaria and
polio in this country. Congress passed legislation regulating the
quality of food and drugs and assuring that safety and science guided
medical developments. Workplace and product-safety standards resulted
in fewer deaths and injuries from accidents. Effective campaigns cut
tobacco use and alcohol abuse. Employers began providing some workers
with health care coverage, primarily for hospitalization costs. And to
aid some of those left out, President Lyndon B. Johnson persuaded
Congress to establish Medicare and Medicaid to address the poorest,
sickest, oldest and highest-risk patients in our society. As a result
of these accumulated gains, life expectancy grew from 47 years in 1900
to 77 years for those born in 2000.</p>

<p>As astounding as those changes were, we are likely to see even more
revolutionary changes in the next 100 years. Advances in medicine
coincide with advances in computers and communications. The American
workplace is changing in response to global pressures. But even
positive advances may come with a negative underside. Our affluence
contributes to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle that, combined with
a diet filled with sugar and fat-rich foods, undermines our ability to
fend off chronic diseases like diabetes. And research is proving that
the pollutants and contaminants in our environment cause disease and
mortality.</p>

<p>It is overwhelming just thinking about the problems, never mind
dealing with them. But we have to begin applying American ingenuity and
resolve or watch the best health care system in the world deteriorate. </p>

<p>Medical Advances <br>
The pace of scientific development in medicine is so rapid that the
next hundred years is likely to be called the Century of the Life
Sciences. We have mapped the human genome and seen the birth of the
burgeoning field of genomics, offering the opportunity to pinpoint and
modify the genes responsible for a whole host of conditions. Scientists
are exploring whether nanotechnology can target drugs to diseased
tissues or implant sensors to detect disease in its earliest forms. We
can look forward to ''designer drugs'' tailored to individual genetic
profiles. But the advances we herald carry challenges and costs.</p>

<p>Think about the potential for inequities in drug research. Today,
pharmaceutical and biotech companies have little incentive to research
and develop treatments for individuals with rare diseases. Never heard
of progeria? That's the point. This fatal syndrome, also called
premature-aging disease, affects one in four million newborns a year.
It's rare enough that there is no profit in developing a cure. This is
known as the ''orphan drug'' problem. Genetic profiles and
individualized therapies have the potential to increase the problem of
orphaned drugs by further fragmenting the market. Even manufacturers of
drugs for conditions like high blood pressure might focus their efforts
on people with common genetic profiles. Depending on your genes, you
could be out of luck.</p>

<p>The increasing understanding and use of genomics may also undermine
the insurance system. Health insurance, like other insurance, exists to
protect against unpredictable, costly events. It is based on risk. As
genetic information allows us to predict illness with greater
certainty, it threatens to turn the most susceptible patients into the
most vulnerable. Many of us will become uninsurable, like the two young
sisters with a congenital disease I met in Cleveland. Their father went
from insurance company to insurance company trying to get coverage,
until one insurance agent looked at him and said, ''We don't insure
burning houses.''</p>

<p>Many have worked to get laws on the books to protect people from
genetic discrimination, but we have yet to pass legislation that
addresses job security and health coverage. The challenges do not stop
there. Health insurance will have to change fundamentally to cope with
predictable, knowable risks. Will health insurance companies offer
coverage tailored to a person's future health prospects? Right now, if
you have asthma, or even just allergies, insurers in the individual
market can exclude your respiratory system from your health insurance
policy. Will all health plans stop offering benefits that relate to
genetic diseases?</p>

<p>The ability to predict illness may overwhelm more than just the
insurance system; it may overwhelm the patient and the provider.
Studies in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that
nearly 6 out of 10 patients at risk for breast and ovarian cancer
declined a genetic test, and a similar fraction of those at risk for
colon cancer also declined testing. Why? One reason is probably to
avoid higher insurance premiums. But the decision to undergo genetic
testing is a complex one that involves many issues. Positive test
results often indicate increased risk but no certainty that a disease
will occur. Negative results also come without guarantees. The
development of genetic profiles and individual therapies will
exponentially increase the amount of information a physician is
expected to manage. Instead of remembering one or two drugs for any
condition, a physician will have to analyze all the different genetic,
demographic and behavioral variables to generate optimal treatment for
a patient.</p>

<p>Medical advances have the potential to overwhelm the health care
system top to bottom. At the very least, the pace of technological
progress is so rapid that our antiquated health care system is ill
equipped to deliver the fruits of that progress. But these advances are
not occurring in isolation from other factors affecting both how we
finance health care and how much care we need and expect. </p>

<p>Globalization <br>
The globalization of our economy has changed everything from how we
work as individuals to what we produce as a nation to how quickly
diseases can spread. American companies -- and workers -- compete not
only with one another but all over the world. It is called competitive
advantage, but it can put American businesses and workers at a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>The United States' closest economic rivals have mandatory national
health care systems rather than the voluntary employer-based model we
have. Automakers in the United States and Canada pay taxes to help
finance public health care. But in the United States, automakers also
pay about $1,300 per midsize car produced for private employee health
insurance. Automakers in Canada come out ahead, according to recent
news reports, even after paying higher taxes.</p>

<p>At the same time, American companies are outsourcing jobs to
countries where the price of labor does not include health coverage,
which costs Americans jobs and puts pressure on employers who continue
to cover their employees at home.</p>

<p>And many new jobs, especially those in the service sector and
part-time jobs, don't include comprehensive health benefits. More
uninsured and underinsured workers impose major strains on a health
system that relies on employer-based insurance. In addition, the
failure of government to help contain health costs for employers has
led to a fraying of the implicit social contract in which a good job
came with affordable coverage.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when a young person would start in the mail room
and stay with the company until retirement. Employee mobility is now
the rule rather than the exception. Those who pay for health care --
insurance companies and employers -- increasingly deal with employees
who change jobs every few years. This has the effect of not only
increasing the numbers of uninsured but also of decreasing the
incentive for employers to underwrite access to preventive care.</p>

<p>At the same time, war, poverty, environmental degradation and
increased world travel for business and pleasure mean greater migration
of people across borders. And with people go diseases. The likes of
SARS can travel quickly from Hong Kong to Toronto, and news of a
strange flu in Asia worries us in New York. Welcome to the world
without borders.</p>

<p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer Laurie Garrett has
described it as ''payback for decades of shunning the desperate health
needs of the poor world.'' No matter the blame, the need to act now to
address issues of global health is no longer just a moral imperative;
it is self-interest. </p>

<p>Lifestyle and Demographic Changes <br>
One hundred years ago, who could have predicted that living longer would be a problem?</p>

<p>In three decades, the number of Medicare beneficiaries will double.
By the year 2050, one in five Americans will be 65 or older. We will
have to find a way to finance the growing demand not only for health
care but also for long-term care, which is now largely left out of
Medicare.</p>

<p>Our society's affluence is only half of the story. Widening
disparities in wealth and in health care too often cleave along ethnic
lines. Today, a Hispanic child with asthma is far less likely than a
non-Hispanic white child to get needed medication. African-Americans
are systematically less likely to get state-of-the-art cardiac care. As
our country becomes more and more diverse, these disparities become
more obvious and more intolerable.</p>

<p>Our changing lifestyles also contribute to behavior-induced health
problems. We can shop online, order in fast food, drive to our errands.
Entertainment -- movies, TV, video games and music -- is one click
away. The physical activity required to get through the day has
decreased, while the pace and stress of daily life has quickened,
affecting mental health. Persistent poverty, risky behaviors like
substance abuse and unprotected sex and pollution from cars and power
plants all add to the country's health problems. As Judith Stern of the
University of California at Davis so aptly put it, genetics may load
the gun, but environment pulls the trigger. </p>

<p>Old Problems Persist <br>
If all we had to do was face these tremendous changes, that would be
daunting enough. But many of the systemic problems we have struggled
with for decades -- like high costs and the uninsured -- are simply
getting worse.</p>

<p>In 1993, the critics predicted that if the Clinton administration's
universal health care coverage plan became law, costs would go through
the roof. ''Hospitals will have to close,'' they said, ''Families will
lose their choice of doctors. Bureaucrats will deny medically necessary
care.''</p>

<p>They were half-right. All that has happened. They were just wrong about the reason.</p>

<p>In 1993, there were 37 million uninsured Americans. In the late
90's, the situation improved slightly, largely because of the improved
economy and the passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program. But
now some 43.6 million Americans are uninsured, and the vast majority of
them are in working families.</p>

<p>While employer-sponsored insurance remains a major source of
coverage for workers, it is becoming less accessible and affordable for
spouses, dependents and retirees. In 1993, 46 percent of companies with
500 or more employees offered some type of retiree health benefit. That
declined to 29 percent in 2001. When you think about the new economy
and worker mobility, it's no wonder employers are dropping retiree
health benefits. You can only wonder how many yet-to-retire workers are
next.</p>

<p>Even those Americans not among the ranks of the uninsured
increasingly find themselves underinsured. In 2003, two-thirds of
companies with 200 or more employees dealt with increasing costs by
increasing the share that their employees had to pay and dropping
coverage for particular services. With rising deductibles and co-pays,
even if you have insurance, you may not be able to afford the care you
need, and some benefits, like mental health services, may not be
covered at all.</p>

<p>The problem of the uninsured and underinsured affects everyone. A
recent Institute of Medicine study estimates that 18,000 25- to
64-year-old adults die every year as a result of lack of coverage. But
even if you are insured, if you have a heart attack, and the ambulance
that picks you up has to go three hospitals away because the nearby
emergency rooms are full, you will have suffered from our inadequate
system of coverage.</p>

<p>If, as a nation, we were saving money by denying insurance to some
people, you could at least say there's some logic to it -- no matter
how cruel. But that's not the case. Despite the lack of universal
coverage in our country, we still spend much more than countries that
provide health care to all their citizens. We are No. 1 in the world in
health care spending. On a per capita basis, health spending in the
United States is 50 percent higher than the second-highest-spending
country: Switzerland. Our health costs now constitute 14.9 percent of
our gross domestic product and are growing at an alarming rate: by
2013, per capita health care spending is projected to increase to 18.4
percent of G.D.P.</p>

<p>What drives skyrocketing spending? The cost of prescription drugs
rose almost twice as fast as spending on all health services, 40
percent in just the last few years.</p>

<p>Hospital costs have been rising as well, in large measure because
more than one in four health care dollars go to administration. In
1999, that meant $300 billion per year went to pay for administrative
bureaucracy: accountants and bookkeepers, who collect bills, negotiate
with insurance companies and squeeze every possible reimbursement out
of public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Asthma and other
pulmonary disorders linked to pollution contribute significantly to
these costs, according to the health economist Ken Thorpe. Diabetes,
high blood pressure and mental illness are also among the conditions
that keep these costs rising.</p>

<p>If we spend so much, even after administrative costs, why does the
United States rank behind 47 other countries in life expectancy and
42nd in infant mortality?</p>

<p>A lot of the money Americans spend is wasted on care that doesn't
improve health. A recent study by Dartmouth researchers argues that
close to a third of the $1.6 trillion we now spend on health care goes
to care that is duplicative, fails to improve patient health or may
even make it worse. A study in Santa Barbara, Calif., found that one
out of every five lab tests and X-rays were conducted solely because
previous test results were unavailable. A recent study found that for
two-thirds of the patients who received a $15,000 surgery to prevent
stroke, there was no compelling evidence that the surgery worked.</p>

<p>In situations in which the benefits of intervention are clear, many
patients are not receiving that care. For example, few hospitalized
patients at risk for bacterial pneumonia get the vaccine against it
during their hospital stays. A recent study in The New England Journal
of Medicine by Elizabeth McGlynn found that, overall, Americans are
getting the care they should only 55 percent of the time.</p>

<p>As a whole, our ailing health care system is plagued with underuse,
overuse and misuse. In a fundamental way, we pay far more for less than
citizens in other advanced economies get. </p>

<p>How We Deliver Care <br>
There is no ''one size fits all'' solution to our health care problems,
but there are common-sense solutions that call for aggressive, creative
and effective strategies as bold in their approach as they are
practical in their effect.</p>

<p>First, the way we deliver health care must change. For too long our
model of health care delivery has been based on the provider, the
payer, anyone but the patient. Think about the fact that our medical
records are still owned by a physician or a hospital, in bits and
pieces, with no reasonable way to connect the dots of our conditions
and our care over the years.</p>

<p>If we as individuals are responsible for keeping our own passports,
401(k) and tax files, educational histories and virtually every other
document of our lives, then surely we can be responsible for keeping,
or at least sharing custody of, our medical records. Studies have shown
that when patients have a greater stake in their own care, they make
better choices.</p>

<p>We should adopt the model of a ''personal health record'' controlled
by the patient, who could use it not only to access the latest reliable
health information on the Internet but also to record weight and blood
sugar and to receive daily reminders to take asthma or cholesterol
medication. Moreover, our current system revolves around ''cases''
rather than patients. Reimbursements are based on ''episodes of
treatment'' rather than on a broader consideration of a patient's
well-being. Thus it rewards the treatment of discrete diseases and
injuries rather than keeping the patient alive and healthy. While we
assure adequate privacy protections, we need care to focus on the
patient.</p>

<p>Our system rewards clinicians for providing more services but not
for keeping patients healthier. The structure of the health care system
should shift toward rewarding doctors and health plans that treat
patients with their long-term health needs in mind and rewarding
patients who make sensible decisions about maintaining their own
health. </p>

<p>Harnessing Modernization <br>
As paradoxical as it is that advances in medical technology could
potentially break our antiquated system, advances in other technologies
may hold the answer to saving it. Using a 20th-century health care
system to deal with 21st-century problems is nowhere more true than in
the failure to use information technology.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, the Internet was used primarily by academics and the
military. Now it is possible to imagine all of a person's health files
stored securely on a computer file -- test results, lab records, X-rays
-- accessible from any doctor's office. It is easy to imagine, yet our
medical system is not there.</p>

<p>The average emergency-room doctor or nurse has minutes to gather
information on a patient, from past records and from interviewing the
patient or relatives. In the age of P.D.A.'s, why are these
professionals forced to rely on a patient's memory?</p>

<p>Information technology can also be used to disseminate research. A
government study recently documented that it takes 17 years from the
time of a new medical discovery to the time clinicians actually
incorporate that discovery into their practice at the bedside. Why not
17 seconds?</p>

<p>Why rely solely on the doctor's brain to store that information?
Computers could crunch the variables on a particular patient's medical
history, constantly update the algorithms with the latest scientific
evidence and put that information at the clinician's fingertips at the
point of care.</p>

<p>Americans may not be getting the care they should 45 percent of the
time, but the tools exist to narrow that gap. Research shows that when
physicians receive computerized reminders, statistics improve
exponentially. Reminders can take the form of an alert in the
electronic health record that the hospitalized patient has not had a
pneumonia vaccine or as computerized questions to remind a doctor of
the conditions that must be fulfilled before surgery is considered
appropriate.</p>

<p>Newt Gingrich and I have disagreed on many issues, including health
care, but I agree with some of the proposals he outlines in his book
''Saving Lives and Saving Money,'' which support taking advantage of
technological changes to create a more modern and efficient health care
system. I have introduced legislation that promotes the use of
information technology to update our health care system and organize it
around the best interests of patients. Improvements in technology will
end the paper chase, limit errors and reduce the number of malpractice
suits.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that savings from information technology should
not just be diffused throughout the system, never to be recaptured, but
should be used to make substantial progress toward real universal
coverage. By better using technology, we can lower health care costs
throughout the system and thereby lower the exorbitant premiums that
are placing a financial squeeze on businesses, individuals and the
government. At the same time, some of those savings should be used to
make substantial progress toward real universal coverage. (I may have
just lost Newt Gingrich.) </p>

<p>Taking the Broader View: Public Health And Prevention <br>
While we focus on empowering the individual through technology, we also
have to recognize the larger factors that affect our health -- from the
environment to public health.</p>

<p>If asthma and other pulmonary disorders are the main drivers of
increased health spending, that argues strongly that we should rethink
how social and environmental factors impact our collective health.
Consider that over the last century we have extended life expectancy by
30 years but that only 8 of those years can be credited to medical
intervention. The rest of our gains stem from the construction of water
and sewer systems, draining mosquito-infested swamps and addressing
spoilage, quality and nutrition in our food supply. Yet we continue to
underinvest in these important systematic measures -- resulting in
expensive health consequences like the explosion of asthma among
children living in New York City or the harmful levels of lead found
among children drinking water from the District of Columbia water
system.</p>

<p>Our neglect of public health also contributes to spiraling health
costs. We tend to address health care -- as a nation and as individuals
-- after the sickness has taken hold, rather than addressing the cause
through public health. Public health programs can help stop preventable
disease and control dangerous behaviors. Take obesity, for example.
Individuals should understand that they put their lives at risk with
unhealthy behavior. But let's face it -- we live in a fast-food nation,
and we need to take steps, like restoring physical-education programs
in schools, that support the individual's ability to master his or her
own health. Studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have identified ''Programs That Work,'' which should be
financed. It comes down to individual responsibility reinforced by
national policy.</p>

<p>The public health system also needs to be brought up to date. The
current public health tools were developed when the major threats to
health were infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. But now
chronic diseases are the No. 1 killer in our country. We need to be
concerned not just about pathogens but also about carcinogens.</p>

<p>Over the last three years, I have introduced legislation to increase
investment in tracking and correlating environmental and health
conditions. I have met with people from Long Island to Fallon, Nev.,
who want answers about cancer clusters in their communities. The data
we have seen about lead and mercury contamination in our food and water
suggest that the effects they have on the fetus and children may have
contributed to the increasing number of children in special education
with attention and learning disorders. We need more research to
determine once and for all if increasing pollution in our communities
and increasing rates of learning-related disabilities are cause and
effect.</p>

<p>We should also be looking at sprawl -- talking about the way we
design our neighborhoods and schools and about our shrinking supply of
safe, usable outdoor space -- and how that contributes to asthma,
stress and obesity. We should follow the example of the European Union
and start testing the chemicals we use every day and not wait until we
have a rash of birth defects or cancers on our hands before taking
action. And we should look at factors in our society that lead to youth
violence, substance abuse, depression and suicide and ultimately
require insurance and treatment for mental health.</p>

<p>After Sept. 11, mental health was a significant factor in the health
toll on our nation's first responders. And yet our mental health
delivery system is underfinanced and unprepared.</p>

<p>Finally, as a society, we need greater emphasis on preventive care,
an investment in people and their health that saves us money, because
when families can't get preventive care, they often end up in the
emergency room -- getting the most expensive care possible. </p>

<p>Expanding Coverage <br>
All that we have learned in the last decade confirms that our goal
should continue to be what every other industrialized nation has
achieved -- health care that's always there for every citizen.</p>

<p>For the first time, this year a nonpartisan group dedicated to
improving the nation's health, the Institute of Medicine, recommended
that by 2010 everyone in the United States should have health
insurance. Such a system would promote better overall health for
individuals, families, communities and our nation by providing
financial access for everyone to necessary, appropriate and effective
health services.</p>

<p>It will, as I have been known to say, take the whole village to
finance an affordable and accountable health system. Employers and
individuals would share in its financing, and individuals would have to
assume more responsibility for improving their own health and
lifestyles. Private insurers and public programs would work together,
playing complementary roles in ensuring that all Americans have the
health care they need. Our society is already spending $35 billion a
year to treat people who have no health insurance, and our economy
loses $65 billion to $130 billion in productivity and other costs. We
are already spending what it would cost if we reallocated those
resources and required responsibility.</p>

<p>In the post 9/11 world, there is one more reason for universal
coverage. The anthrax and ricin episodes, and the continuing threat
posed by biological, chemical and radiological weapons, should make us
painfully aware of the shortcomings of our fragmented system of health
care. Can you imagine the aftermath of a bioterrorism attack, with
thousands of people flooding emergency rooms and bureaucrats demanding
proof of insurance coverage from each and every one? Those without
coverage might not see a doctor until after they had infected others.</p>

<p>Insurance should be about sharing risk and responsibility -- pooling
resources and risk to protect ourselves from the devastating cost of
illness or injury. It should not be about further dividing us.
Competition should reward health plans for quality and cost savings,
not for how many bad risks they can exclude -- especially as we enter
the genomic age, when all of us could have uninsurable risks written
into our genes.</p>

<p>So achieving comprehensive health care reform is no simple feat, as
I learned a decade ago. None of these ideas mean anything if the
political will to ensure that they happen doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Some people believe that the only solution to our present cost
explosion is to shift the cost and risk onto individuals in what is
called ''consumer driven'' health care. Each consumer would have an
individual health care account and would monitor his or her own
spending. But instead of putting consumers in the driver's seat, it
actually leaves consumers at the mercy of a broken market. This system
shifts the costs, the risks and the burdens of disease onto the
individuals who have the misfortune of being sick. Think about the
times you have been sick or injured -- were you able under those
circumstances to negotiate for the best price or shop for the best
care? And instead of giving individuals, providers and payers
incentives for better care, this cost-shifting approach actually causes
individuals to delay or skip needed services, resulting in worse health
and more expensive health needs later on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, proposals like those for individual health insurance tax
credits, without reforms for the individual insurance market, leave
individuals in the lurch as well. We know that asthmatics can have
their entire respiratory systems excluded from coverage. Individual
insurance companies can increase your premium or limit coverage for
factors like age, previous medical history or even flat feet. Those in
the individual market cannot pool their risk with colleagues or other
members of the group. The coverage you can get and the price you pay
for it will reflect individual risk, and you simply don't receive many
of the benefits of what we consider traditional insurance when people
pool risks. So the proposal to give individuals tax credits to buy
coverage in the individual market, without any rules of fair play,
won't provide much help for Americans who need health care. In the same
way, the recent Medicare bill, which seeks to privatize Medicare
benefits, long a government guarantee, threatens to leave the ''bad
risks'' without any affordable coverage. With the new genetic
information at our disposal, that could mean any one of us could one
day be denied health insurance.</p>

<p>When many of those who opposed the Health Security Act look back,
they are still proud of their achievement in blocking our reform plan.
The focus of that proposal was to cover everybody by enabling the
healthier to pool the ''risk'' with others. The plan was to redirect
what we currently pay for uninsured care into expanding health coverage.</p>

<p>We could make cosmetic changes to the system we currently have, but
that would simply take what is already a Rube Goldberg contraption and
make it larger and even more unwieldy. We could go the route many have
advocated, putting the burden almost entirely on individuals, thereby
creating a veritable nationwide health care casino in which you win or
lose should illness strike you or someone in your family. Or we could
decide to develop a new social contract for a new century premised on
joint responsibility to prevent disease and provide those who need care
access to it. This would not let us as individuals off the hook. In
fact, joint responsibility demands accountability from patients,
employers, payers and society as a whole.</p>

<p>What will we say about ourselves 10 years from today? If we finally
act to reform what we know needs to change, we may take credit in
building a health care system that covers everyone and improves the
quality of all our lives. But if we continue to dither and disagree,
divided by ideology and frozen into inaction by competing special
interests, then we will share in the blame for the collapse of health
care in America, where rising costs break the back of our economy and
leave too many people without the medical attention they need.</p>

<p>The nexus of globalization, the revolution in medical technology and
the seismic pressures imposed by the contradictions in our current
health care system will force radical changes whether we choose them or
not. We can do nothing, we can take incremental steps -- or we can
implement wide-ranging reform.</p>

<p>To me, the case for action is clear. And as we work to develop
long-term solutions, we can take steps now to help address the
immediate problems we face. As Senator John Kerry has proposed, we
should cover everyone living in poverty, and all children; allow people
to buy into the federal employee health benefits program; and also help
employers by reinsuring high-cost claims while assuming more of the
costs from hard-pressed state and local governments.</p>

<p>We can pass real privacy legislation that will ensure that Americans
continue to feel secure in the trust they place in others for their
most intimate medical information. And we can realize the promise of
savings through information technology and disease management by
passing quality health legislation now.</p>

<p>If we do not fix the problems of the present, we are doomed to live
with the consequences in the future. As someone who tried to promote
comprehensive health care reform a decade ago and decided to push for
incremental changes in the years since, I still believe America needs
sensible, wide-ranging reform that leads to quality health care
coverage available to all Americans at an affordable cost.</p>

<p>The present system is unsustainable. The only question is whether we will master the change or it will master us. </p>

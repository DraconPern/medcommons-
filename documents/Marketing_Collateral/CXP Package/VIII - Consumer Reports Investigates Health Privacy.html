Hindsight is 20/20, and foresight can be, too. The latest example: the
promise and peril of electronically storing all the data in your
private medical records.
<br>
<br>
The federal government is working right now to convert bulging
drawers of paper medical records into computer files, then linking
those files to a central system (see our March 2006 report on <a
 href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/health-fitness/health-care/electronic-medical-records-306/overview.htm">Electronic
medical records</a>).
Once this information network is established, your blood pressure and
cholesterol levels, your bone and brain scans, will be accessible
electronically, just as your banking and other financial records are
now. That's precisely why consumer groups and patients must have a say
in the development of the network and the standards that govern it. If
we don't, we'll be scrambling to stop the same abuses and fix the same
problems that we face in protecting our financial information.
<br>
<br>
There's widespread agreement on the need to accelerate the use of
information technology in our otherwise high-tech health-care system.
Most hospitals and doctors' offices still store patient records on
paper, making the history of our medical care hard to transfer from one
hospital or doctor to another. The inefficiencies of this system lead
to medical errors and the loss or misplacement of vital information. As
for the patients, we rarely see our own fragmented records or track our
own health histories.
<br>
<br>
The federal Department of Health and Human Services has launched a
program to speed up the adoption of electronic health records and to
form a network linking them nationwide. The Senate passed legislation
in November that includes a call for &#8220;uniform and consistent
implementation of any standards for the electronic exchange of health
information&#8221;; the House is expected to consider bills this year. Some
hospitals and doctors' offices already use electronic records and
stored MRIs, X-rays, and CAT scans.
<br>
<br>
The problem is that current and pending legislation doesn't provide
adequate protection of your privacy as a patient. The potential for
unintended leaks and outright abuse is high. None of us should tolerate
a system that fails to protect our privacy. Last year, Consumers Union,
the nonprofit publisher of this magazine, and eight other patient and
consumer organizations drafted principles that we believe should guide
the development of any electronic health-information network (go to <a
 href="javascript:Start('http://www.ConsumersUnion.org')"><em>www.ConsumersUnion.org</em></a>
for the full list and what you can do). Among them:
<br>
<br>
&#8226; It must be able to transfer health records reliably and securely.
<br>
<br>
&#8226; The governance and administration of a national health-information
network must be public, transparent, and accountable.
<br>
<br>
&#8226; We should be able to review and control who has access to our
personal health information and to supplement, annotate, or correct our
records.
<br>
<br>
&#8226; We should be told in simple, easily understood language how our
health information might be used, and be able to choose whether we want
to make it available for those purposes.
<br>
<br>
The time to get this right is right now.

A national system of electronic medical records could easily save your
life. And it could also jeopardize the security of your personal health
information.<br>
      <br>
Let&#8217;s say you have a heart attack. You could be swooshing down the
water slide at Walt Disney World&#8217;s Typhoon Lagoon, teeing off at the
16th hole at Pebble Beach, or raking leaves in your backyard.<br>
      <br>
Your odds of survival would soar because the emergency-room computer
would let the doctor on duty connect to the Internet, type in a
password, and with a few clicks, view your medical history. He could
see your most recent test and lab results, a list of your allergies,
and all your medications. With all that information, he could begin
treating you immediately.<br>

That scenario is not science fiction. The federal government is
fostering the creation of a national system of electronic health
records (EHRs) under the leadership of David Brailer, a 46-year-old
physician and former software company CEO who is now at the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. His charge: to help build the
National Health Information Network, which will electronically connect
all patients&#8217; records to health-care providers, insurers, pharmacies,
labs, and claims processors by 2009.<br>
      <br>
The network&#8217;s potential to save money, to make medical care more
efficient, and to lower the incidence of deadly drug reactions and
interactions has spurred state government agencies, foundations, HMOs,
PPOs, and hospital chains to develop their own electronic records
systems, some of which are already up and running. &#8220;Electronic health
records will reengineer health care in a way that will save thousands
of lives and billions of dollars,&#8221; Brailer says.<br>
      <br>
But troubling questions come with the promises. Will such private
information be safeguarded from marketers who might want to sell you a
new drug to treat your asthma, or from fund-raisers who target you
because the diagnosis of your new disease diagnosis might encourage you
to contribute?<br>
      <br>
Could computer hackers or pranksters release the information onto the
Internet, where your co-workers could learn, say, that you are being
treated for alcoholism? Might your record become available to potential
employers or lenders who decide that you&#8217;re not healthy enough to
perform the job or handle a 30-year mortgage? And will you be able to
control who has access to or find out who has viewed your medical
records?<br>
      <br>
Brailer says that consumers will be able to see their records and
correct errors (assuming that they can decipher the medical
gobbledygook). But the cost to consumers remains unclear. Brailer
initially told us that consumers will pay an access fee. But he later
said that access would be free. Jim Pyles, a Washington, D.C.,
constitutional lawyer and privacy expert, objects. &#8220;There is no reason
there should be access to your records without your consent unless
required by law or your life is in jeopardy,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and you
certainly should not have to pay for access to your own information.&#8221;<br>

the doctor&#8217;s office</b></span><br>
            <br>
Chances are that in the last few years, you&#8217;ve been asked to endorse
dozens of so-called privacy agreements while sitting in doctors&#8217;
waiting rooms. Under the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA), health-care providers have the right to
share your data for several purposes: to treat you, which means, for
example, they may discuss your case and send data about you to a
radiologist about which ankle to X-ray; to process your insurance
claim; and to respond to requests from public-health authorities, law
enforcement, and your employer if you were hurt at work.<br>
            <br>
All of that seems reasonable, but you might not realize that HIPAA also
allows health-care providers to share information with health-care
business associates. So notes from your psychotherapy session may be
given to your insurers&#8217; employees for &#8220;training purposes.&#8221; And don&#8217;t
forget about fund-raisers. For example, the agreement of Michael
Bermant, a plastic surgeon in Chester, Va., says, &#8220;We may use or
disclose your demographic information and the dates that you received
treatment from us in order to contact you for fund-raising activities
supported by our office.&#8220;<br>
            <br>
Unfortunately, HIPAA does not give you the right to opt out in most
cases, and the agreements can change at any time. But there are ways to
guard the shreds that are left of your medical privacy:<br>
            <br>
&#8226;
Read notices of privacy practices carefully. If you do not understand
something in the notice, ask questions. Your doctor may agree to keep
personal or very embarrassing information out of your record as long as
its absence will not negatively affect the quality of your care or your
health.<br>
            <br>
&#8226; You do not have to sign the forms.
Unfortunately, refusing to do so will not change the offices&#8217; ability
to share your information. The notice is not a contract; it is merely a
mandated disclosure form to prove that you were informed in writing
about how your data may be shared.<br>
            <br>
&#8226; HIPAA gives
you the right to request that your health-care provider or your health
plan restrict uses or disclosures of your medical information. For
example, you may say that you do not wish to receive fund-raising
materials, a right that is noted in Bermant&#8217;s notice. The provider or
plan, however, is not obligated to agree to the restriction, which
Bermant&#8217;s agreement also notes. But if the provider or plan does agree
to the restriction, which Bermant&#8217;s office says it does, it must abide
by that agreement, except in emergencies. Your request will probably
have to be made in writing. The provider&#8217;s or plan&#8217;s office will then
let you know whether it has decided to abide by your wishes.<br>

<h2><span class="xhead">From folders to networks </span></h2>
<p> <br>
Spread among folders at the offices of maybe a half-dozen doctors and
possibly hospitals, the traditional paper medical record is not
necessarily efficient, secure, or accurate. Employees certainly and
visitors sometimes have access to the folder-lined walls where many
physicians keep their patient data. Charts may be misfiled, pages can
fall out, and a spilled latte can wipe out years of data.<br>
<br>
In recognition of the problems, medical institutions over the years
have turned to computerization to manage patient information. At first
these systems weren&#8217;t connected. But gradually, large health-care
providers, including the Department of Defense, the Department of
Veterans Affairs, and managed-care companies, each linked individual
office computers to form integrated systems that would allow
health-care workers to retrieve patients&#8217; test results, including blood
work, radiology, and biopsy reports. <br>
<br>
After 9/11, federal officials recognized that a national system of
interconnected records could help them spot early evidence of
biochemical attacks and epidemics. &#8220;It takes 26 days for our current
fragmented system to process data at the local level, then the state
level, and have it rise to the level of concern to reach the Centers
for Disease Control and be properly analyzed,&#8221; Brailer says. &#8220;In a
fully integrated national system, problems can be spotted in a day.&#8221;<br>
<br>
To have all records connected to a nationwide system, providers,
insurers, pharmacies, and other health-care entities will have to pay
some $150 billion over the next five years. &#8220;It can cost up to $35,000
per doctor to get a fully integrated system in place,&#8221; says Peter
Waegemann, CEO of the Medical Records Institute (MRI), a group that has
promoted the establishment of electronic health records. And, according
to Brailer, some of the costs will eventually be passed on to consumers.<br>
<br>
MRI&#8217;s database contains 2,500 software and hardware suppliers. Some of
them sell systems that support large provider chains. Others peddle
specialty programs, such as ones tailored to dentists. &#8220;The problem is
that most of these systems are not compatible, so they can&#8217;t
communicate,&#8221; Waegemann says. &#8220;We need standards to be implemented or
else the whole system could collapse.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2><span class="xhead">The promises</span></h2>
<p> <br>
So far, the development of medical information networks has been
sporadic, but those in operation are already offering advantages to
both doctors and patients. The VA has one of the few systems in place.
Two physicians at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington,
D.C., showed us how a patient&#8217;s computerized record gives them access
to layers of information, including notes from office visits, hospital
admissions and discharge notes, special patient problems, allergies,
diagnostic test results, and a list of the patient&#8217;s medications. <br>
<br>
Alerts signal the doctor if the patient is due for a test or procedure.
With a click, test results fill the screen, including CAT scans, MRIs,
and EKGs. Some of the images appear in 3D and can be rotated for a
360-degree view. A doctor at any of the VA&#8217;s 1,300 care-center
locations across the nation can pull up a patient&#8217;s file and add
information to it if a veteran is treated at that facility.<br>
<br>
The system gives patients control over their medical care. Two Web
sites called My Health<em>e</em>Vet--one of them a pilot with more
features--allow some 155,000 participating patients to have instant
access to some of their medical records. Using an Internet connection,
they can read their doctor&#8217;s summary of a visit, see test and lab
results the day after they come in, and type in any data they want to
track on their own, such as blood-sugar level, blood pressure, or
weight. <br>
<br>
More precise patient care from doctors, greater participation by
patients, and an early-warning system for medical disasters such as the
appearance of avian flu are the hopes for an electronic records
network. Another is the potential savings in health-care expenditures,
which reached $1.9 trillion in 2004.<br>
<br>
According to a RAND Corporation study published in September 2005,
successful adoption of health-information technology by 90 percent of
doctors and hospitals would cut health-care spending by $77 billion
annually. The biggest savings would come partly from shorter hospital
stays prompted by better-coordinated care and fewer redundant tests and
procedures. Fewer prescription errors, another benefit of computerized
systems&#8217; warning doctors and pharmacists of potential adverse drug
reactions, could shave off $4 billion. <br>
</p>
<p> <br>
</p>
<h2><span class="xhead">Errors across the Internet</span></h2>
<p> <br>
Anyone who has recently examined his or her credit report knows that
errors are common and often significant. Errors in a medical record
could be fatal. <br>
<br>
It&#8217;s axiomatic that paper records have errors. But the records don&#8217;t
have much reach. An error in your EHR, however, that says you have a
possibly stigmatizing condition (depression, addiction, a sexually
transmitted disease) can be seen by many people before you even know of
the error.<br>
<br>
The likelihood of errors could also increase when lots of people have
the ability to enter data. John Halamka, a physician and chairman of
the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel, whose job it is
to set data standards for exchange of information over the network,
insists that security will be tight. Each local network would require
that individuals logging into the system have unique IDs tied to a
designation such as R.N. or M.D. A patient&#8217;s information would be
divided into subsets so that the dentist&#8217;s nurse would be unable to
view or alter the diagnosis of your psychiatrist. Or gossip about it to
neighbors.<br>
<br>
Without such safeguards, some consumers might be reluctant to seek
treatment for certain conditions out of fear of discovery. &#8220;No one
wants strangers to see the details of things like their cancer
treatments, or their parent&#8217;s sexual dysfunction, or their child&#8217;s
diagnosis by a therapist,&#8221; says Deborah Peel, M.D., a psychoanalyst in
Austin, Texas, and president of Patient Privacy Rights, a nonprofit
medical-privacy watchdog group. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h2><span class="xhead">Eyes on your records</span></h2>
<p> <br>
As things stand now, HIPAA regulations allow your medical information
to be shared by hundreds of thousands of people without your
knowledge--to treat you and to process billing. But the data can also
go to health-care-related businesses. &#8220;Medical ethics have always
allowed doctors to share information about you with your consent to
ensure you are properly treated and to process insurance claims,&#8221; says
Pyles, the privacy expert. &#8220;It&#8217;s that third category, sharing with
health-care-related businesses, that&#8217;s troublesome.&#8221; Troublesome
because there are 600,000 health-care-related companies in the U.S.,
according to estimates by the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS), including drugmakers, fund-raisers, health-care researchers, law
practices, law enforcement, marketing companies, and transcription
services. And those businesses can share your data with their
affiliates. <br>
<br>
That could total over a million firms, and there is no requirement in
the rule that says you have to be notified when your record is shared
with them,&#8221; Pyles says. HHS estimated that obtaining your consent every
time your data were shared could cost $103 million over 10 years. <br>
<br>
Your information could also be included in health-care research or
public-health programs without your knowledge. Even if you find out
about the research and request that your data not be included, the
public-health organization is not required to acquiesce. <br>
<br>
In January 2006, for example, the New York City Department of Health
began a program to monitor the blood-test results of more than 500,000
diabetic city residents. Labs are required to send test results
electronically to the department, which analyzes them to identify
people who are having trouble managing the disease. Patients are unable
to have results excluded. <br>
<br>
Patients deemed at risk may receive letters or phone calls from
physicians urging them to take their medication, get more frequent
checkups, or alter their diet; patients can, however, opt out of the
intervention portion of the program.<br>
<br>
Although many companies might already have access to your data, a
network of electronic records has the potential to spread it much
farther at a more rapid rate. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot harder to share information
that&#8217;s sitting in paper files in lots of different doctor&#8217;s offices
now,&#8221; Peel says. <br>
<br>
The HIPAA law allows data to be shared with health-care businesses, and
privacy advocates worry that an electronic system could allow your
insurer to share data about you with its affiliate, which could be your
bank, which in turn may be doing some health-care consulting. Your
employer may obtain your info if it is an affiliate of a health insurer
or if it self-insures. And note that any negative results of an
employer-sponsored physical or test are not adequately protected
information under HIPAA.<br>
<br>
A corporation that is considering acquiring a pharmacy group or
insurance company will be able to view its members&#8217; records as part of
its due diligence. Data warehouses that process prescription data for
pharmacies may share information with drugmakers about who takes which
medicines to improve marketing. <br>
<br>
The information may include your name, a diagnosis code, and the amount
you paid, for example, but that could be enough to derail your
prospects for a loan or a job. &#8220;You could be charged higher loan rates
or lose a job because of what&#8217;s in your medical record,&#8221; Pyles says.
&#8220;And it will be impossible to prove it was because your data was
shared, rightly or wrongly, because there is no disclosure audit.&#8221;<br>

<h2><span class="xhead">Safeguarding against theft</span></h2>
<h2><span class="xhead"></span></h2>
<p><span class="xhead"> </span><br>
Brailer and other network advocates say that the system will have the
tightest possible security. But recent large-scale thefts of
credit-card and banking information have shown that all databases, even
those with state-of-the-art security protections, can be compromised. <br>
<br>
Electronic health systems now in operation have already sprung some
serious security leaks. In October 2003, for example, a medical
transcriptionist in Pakistan threatened to post patient records from
the University of California at San Francisco&#8217;s Medical Center on the
Internet unless she was paid for her work for a transcription service
hired by the university. The service was forbidden by its contract with
the university to divulge contents of the recording or transcriptions.
But that transcription service had subcontracted to another U.S.
company, which in turn subcontracted to a firm that farmed the work out
to Pakistan. Luckily, a UCSF official says, the woman relented and
promised to destroy the records. UCSF fired its service. Patients, in
the meantime, had no idea their records were being sent overseas. <br>
<br>
In another breach, two computers and a disc containing the confidential
records of close to 200,000 patients of a medical group in San Jose,
Calif., were posted for sale on Craigslist.org, a
classified-advertising Web site. The disc included a wealth of data,
including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, insurance
information, addresses, bill records, and medical histories. A former
branch manager for the medical group was charged in May 2005 with the
theft. At press time, he had not yet entered a plea. The public
defender representing him did not return our calls.<br>
<br>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered the equipment and
software, and the medical group informed current and former patients of
the theft. It&#8217;s not clear what a buyer would do with the information,
but the medical group says that it has received no complaints from
patients.<br>

Orlando Sellers, 57, a Vietnam War vet and a human-resources specialist
at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, D.C.<br>
<b><br>
WHAT</b> Sellers can pull up his electronic medical record at MyHealth<em>e</em>Vet,
a Web site, and enter his daily blood-pressure reading. If he sees that
it&#8217;s spiking, he can send an e-mail note to his doctor, who may then
ask him to come in for a brief checkup. (Sellers&#8217; doctor also checks
his daily blood-pressure entries.)<br>
Sellers takes comfort in the fact that doctors at any of the VA&#8217;s 1,300
U.S. care centers can view his record even if he is unconscious and
rushed to an emergency room. &#8220;It&#8217;s like having luggage that you take on

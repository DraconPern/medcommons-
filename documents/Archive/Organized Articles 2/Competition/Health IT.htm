<span style="font-family: Arial">e-MDs</span></a></span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black"> 
will make its homegrown pharmaceutical reference database freely available as an 
open-source product, the company's chief executive said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;I want to 
accelerate EMR adoption,&quot; e-MDs founder, president, and CEO David Winn, M.D., 
told Health-IT World News, confirming an informal announcement he made during 
the Toward an Electronic Patient Record (TEPR) conference last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The company 
is reviewing the accuracy of its reference materials and is hoping to make the 
information freely available by the middle of July, Winn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Winn added 
that e-MDs is opening up its database as a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot; to vendors selling 
to small and mid-size physician practices. The company mostly targets practices 
with fewer than 20 doctors; its largest customer has 44 physicians, according to 
Winn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Vendors that 
license reference materials from other publishers normally pass on the licensing 
fees to their customers, but that can price their products out of the market for 
small practices, Winn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;One of the 
problems with EMR adoption is perceived cost,&quot; he said. &quot;Physicians really are 
fixated on cost.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">E-MDs began 
developing its own database for drug reference and interactions about five years 
ago as a way to hold down the cost of its EMR, according to Winn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;I think we 
have probably 99% of the drugs out there [in the e-MDs database],&quot; he said. 
&quot;It's very comprehensive.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">With an 
open-source product, users can provide feedback via a public Web site to help 
keep the database updated and accurate as new drugs and scientific research 
become available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">However, 
Winn does expect some backlash from two leading pharmaceutical reference 
publishers, </span>

<span style="font-family: Arial">First Data Bank</span></a></span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">. 
Winn said that drug databases represent a &quot;cash cow&quot; for both companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">A First Data 
Bank spokesperson had no comment. Officials from Medi-Span, a unit of Wolters 
Kluwer Health, were not available for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Winn said 
that e-MDs eventually hopes to turn over distribution of the drug reference to 
one or more medical associations or government agencies. He said he has met with 
American Medical Association trustee Joseph Heyman, M.D., and Thomas Sullivan, 
M.D., immediate past president of the Massachusetts Medical Society -- both 
well-known advocates of clinical IT -- and that he has been approached by the 
federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The AMA 
confirmed the meeting with Heyman but said that the organization has not 
received a formal proposal from e-MDs.</span></p>

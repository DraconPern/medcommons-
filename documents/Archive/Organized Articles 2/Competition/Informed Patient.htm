PATIENT </span></span>
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black"><br>
By LAURA LANDRO</span></p>
<p class="articletitle">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Push Grows for 
Online Health Data</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">A male office 
worker lowers his voice so colleagues won't hear the phone call to his doctor, 
but he finally has to say it loud enough for everyone to hear. &quot;It's a 
rash...There's a lot of itching involved.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The humorous 
commercial is part of a campaign by Group Health Cooperative of Seattle to 
educate its 545,000 members about the advantages of going digital with medical 
records and doctor-patient communications.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Almost 98,000 
members of the health plan have already signed up with the MyGroupHealth Web 
site, which lets them log on, privately and securely, any time of the day or 
night to make appointments for doctor visits, get lab results, and order drug 
refills online. No more embarrassing calls to doctors from the office. Patients 
also get online access to their records.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The campaign, 
which also includes print ads, is one of several new efforts to get consumers on 
board with the idea of wiring up the nation's health records. By replacing paper 
records with electronic networks, proponents say, patients will soon be able to 
manage their medical care and access their own health information much the way 
they bank and shop online now. Though <b>General Electric</b> has been running 
clever TV ads about the advantages of electronic medical records for more than a 
year as part of a corporate-image campaign, until now no one has taken the 
message directly to patients.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">&quot;The consumer 
has been completely left out of this equation, even though they have the biggest 
stake,&quot; says Brian Baum, a senior scholar at Duke University's Fuqua School of 
Business, which last week announced an ambitious campaign to gain consumer 
support for a national network of electronic medical records. &quot;They have no 
concept of what an electronic medical record could mean for their health and the 
health of their family.&quot;</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Dr. Tang, who 
chaired the government advisory Institute of Medicine committee on patient 
safety, which identified electronic medical records as critical to improving 
patient safety and reducing medical error, says the latest survey of Palo Alto's 
20,000 users shows high satisfaction with the service, particularly because it 
saves time and office visits.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Dr. Tang says 
electronic records help doctors take better care of patients -- and patients 
take better care of themselves. The average doctor spends 38% of the time 
retrieving and entering information in the paper-based medical record, he notes, 
and even then 81% of the time can't find the information needed to make patient 
care decisions.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Relatively few 
Americans have electronic medical records now, but the pressure to adopt them 
widely has never been greater. President Bush called for national adoption of 
electronic records in his recent state of the union address. Though there are 
still issues to be resolved -- such as how much control patients should have 
over their own medical records -- technical standards groups are close to 
agreeing on uniform formats and other basics to lay the foundation for sharing 
information between doctors offices and hospitals. Some 60% of hospitals are 
either currently installing or plan to install a system to handle electronic 
medical records, according to a survey released at the recent annual meeting of 
the Health Information Management and Systems Society, an industry group. Though 
only about 5% of doctors use them, the American Academy of Family Physicians has 
teamed up with medical record suppliers to produce models that doctors can 
afford.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Proponents 
also point to potential public-health benefits. Duke's Fuqua School is proposing 
a &quot;Health Data Exchange,&quot; which would include a national network of medical 
records that could be used to identify public-health threats and measure the 
effectiveness of care. Under its proposal, patients would provide their medical 
histories to the network through an Internet site, and updates to each patient 
medical record would occur automatically each time the patient seeks medical 
care or fills a prescription.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Hearing that, 
some consumers are likely to be alarmed about potential privacy violations. And 
while all patients should be concerned about privacy, there are protections 
being put into place regarding electronic medical records. Indeed, electronic 
medical records are probably more secure than the paper ones floating around 
different doctors' offices and hospitals -- and far easier to access in an 
emergency.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Under the new 
federal privacy law, there are strict rules governing the transfer of medical 
information electronically, and most records are password protected. With Duke's 
Health Data Exchange proposal, for instance, several groups would have access to 
anonymous medical histories, but only those with specific authorization from 
patients would be able to access a medical record with a name attached. And 
among hospitals using electronic medical records, nearly 70% say they use at 
least six security tools, including computer firewalls, user-access controls, 
multi-level passcodes and data encryption.</span></p>
<p class="times">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Until 
consumers are offered an electronic medical record, they won't appreciate its 
advantages. &quot;The medical world is in the same situation that banking was a few 
years ago,&quot; says Pat Wise, who is leading the effort at Health Information 
Management and Systems Society to promote electronic medical records. &quot;Before 
ATMs I was used to going to a bank and writing a check for cash, but then the 
bank introduced it to me and now I can't conceive of not having it.&quot;</span></p>

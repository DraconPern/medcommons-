&quot;If it isn't documented, then it didn't happen,&quot; is the perspective of FDA 
regulators. Inspectors<br>
want to see documented procedures and evidence that these procedures are 
enforced. <br>
Consequently, companies are constantly striving to achieve <b><i>full control</i></b> 
of their Quality and <br>
Regulatory Departments. <b><i>This goal is now within reach!</i></b> <br>

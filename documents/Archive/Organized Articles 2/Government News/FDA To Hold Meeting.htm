<span class="body1"><b>By Mark D. Uehling</b> </span><br>
<span class="body1">Bio-IT World (online) </span><br>
<br>
<span class="body1">(04/13/04)—The Federal Register has sent a little-noticed 
and long-awaited invitation to the pharmaceutical industry and the companies 
that write software for it. </span></span></p>
<p class="text">
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">In the 
Federal Register, published April 8, 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) is quietly offering a chance for the public to comment on how the FDA 
should revisit its 21 CFR Part 11 regulation. </span></p>
<p class="text">
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">As insiders 
know, the Part 11 rule theoretically touches how scientific data is accessed and 
stored at every U.S. company developing drugs or medical devices. In practice, 
however, the FDA let it be known in the summer of 2003 that it was re-examining 
the rule. That’s because of Part 11’s unintended effects, which included 
discouraging the use of electronic data storage and more-efficient computer 
systems.</span></p>
<p class="text">
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The FDA says 
its June meeting is intended to help it move forward with input from outside the 
government. “FDA would like public input to assist with our re-examination of 
Part 11,” the agency said. “We invite discussion on the scope of Part 11, 
risk-based approaches, validation, audit trails, record retention, record 
copying, and legacy systems.” </span></p>
<p class="text">
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The original 
Part 11 rule was regarded in some quarters as unattainably strict. “The bar was 
too high,” says John C. McKenney, president and CEO of SEC Associates, a 
consulting firm in North Carolina. “There were certain requirements that were 
just unreasonable.” On April 1, 2004, McKenney told the 2004 Bio-IT World 
Conference+Expo audience about the FDA meeting, which the FDA later confirmed.
</span></p>
<p class="text">
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The FDA’s 
relaxation of enforcement of selected portions of the regulation does not mean, 
McKenney says, that biotech and pharmaceutical companies can breathe a sigh of 
relief and ignore Part 11 altogether, tempting as that may be. “None of the 
electronic signature guidances were touched,” McKenney notes. “You may want to 
have those audit trails and other features the FDA isn’t pressing for, for other 
business reasons. It’s more important than ever to check for tougher 
requirements that may apply – such as the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) – or legal requirements for evidence and protection of 
intellectual property. It’s really important to take a look at that.”</span></p>
<p class="text">
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The FDA 
meeting will precede the annual Drug Information Association (DIA) meeting and 
will be held on June 11, 2004, at the National Transportation Safety Board 
Boardroom and Conference Center in Washington, D.C. The deadline to register to 
speak at the FDA meeting is May 12, 2004. The announcement can be found

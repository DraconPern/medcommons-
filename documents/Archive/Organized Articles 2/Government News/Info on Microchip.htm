Your Medical History on a Microchip:<br>
Having Key Data Ready in an Emergency</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

<br>
Will your medical records be available if you end up in the emergency<br>
room after a car accident or heart attack?<br>
<br>
Probably not in time to help save your life, thanks to the current<br>
archaic system of paper records.<br>
<br>
The federal government announced ambitious plans last week to create a<br>
vast new information system for patients and to provide incentives for<br>
physicians to adopt electronic records. Electronic medical records can<br>
not only improve the quality of care by giving patients and their<br>
doctors a complete, up-to-date view of a patient's medical history,<br>
medications and allergies but also could help reduce medical errors.<br>
But, with unresolved questions such as who will pay for new technology<br>
and how information will be shared, it may be years before your local<br>
doctor or hospital gets wired.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, a number of new tools and services are making it<br>
possible for consumers to create, store, and share their own medical<br>
records. These range from emergency wallet cards that can be printed off<br>
the Web to portable gadgets that store a family's entire medical history<br>
on a microchip and cost less than a new iPod. A growing number of health<br>
plans are also offering special Web sites with free medical<br>
record-keeping tools for members, which could be particularly useful for<br>
people with chronic conditions like diabetes who need to diligently<br>
track measures such as blood-sugar levels.<br>
<br>
The idea is to put together records that patients control and manage<br>
themselves, collecting data from different providers and sharing it as<br>
they see fit. Consumers surveyed by the group Connecting for Health<br>
became receptive to the idea of electronic medical records after viewing<br>
an ad showing a man falling from a ladder with the caption &quot;You have<br>
three seconds to remember every doctor you've ever seen, every procedure<br>
you've ever undergone and every medicine you've ever taken.&quot; In addition<br>
to recording vital information such as next-of-kin contacts and lists of<br>
allergies, patients could use the records to track their own<br>
immunizations and note any mistakes in their doctor's records.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YOUR PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD<br>
Patients should keep their own set of records. Here's a list of some<br>
essential data that should go into them. . *Medication lists* --<br>
Prescription drugs, over-the-counter supplements<br>
<br>
.. *Immunizations* -- Recent vaccinations<br>
<br>
.. *Problem list* -- Diseases or conditions<br>
<br>
.. *Allergies* -- Drugs or substances that cause reactions<br>
<br>
.. *Images* -- X-rays or scans such as mammograms<br>
<br>
.. *Recent test results* - Blood tests, Pap smears<br>
<br>
.. *Spiritual affiliation* -- Religious preference or considerations<br>

Cynthia Solomon, a Sonoma, Calif., mother, saw the benefits of personal<br>
medical records in electronic form after 20 years of compiling paper<br>
files for her 28-year-old son, who has hydrocephalus, a condition that<br>
leads to abnormal accumulation of fluid in the brain. After he landed in<br>
an unfamiliar hospital's emergency room with no access to his medical<br>
history or past brain scans, Ms. Solomon took out a second mortgage on<br>
her home and hired some programmers to develop an online medical record<br>
that users can program themselves and provide to any doctor that treats<br>
them. A subscription to the site, Followme.com<br>
&lt;<a href="http://65.54.187.250:80/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=93d627d7dcb22d5fe60bd3b0caf611f4&lat=1091064654&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eFollowme%2ecom" target="_blank">http://www.Followme.com</a>&gt;^1 
, costs $35 for an individual and $75 for a<br>
family.<br>
<br>
&quot;Medical practices close, hospitals consolidate, and physical records<br>
can be easily lost,&quot; says Ms. Solomon. &quot;But you need to have your<br>
information available in an emergency and to coordinate your care, and<br>
the technology to do so is here and easily affordable.&quot;<br>
<br>
It isn't just the chronically ill who could benefit from keeping their<br>
own medical records. &quot;We are all at risk if we don't collect and manage<br>
our own health information,&quot; says Marie Savard, a physician who<br>
developed a binder of paper folders several years ago to help patients<br>
keep a set of medical records, including an emergency wallet card with<br>
information such as next-of-kin contacts and prescription-drug lists.<br>
Dr. Savard has since licensed her system to Merck, which lets consumers<br>
download and print 26 different forms for free on its mercksource.com<br>
&lt;<a href="http://65.54.187.250:80/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=2ffabe5452bc624977dca71e8bb1c1da&lat=1091064654&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2emercksource%2ecom" target="_blank">http://www.mercksource.com</a>&gt;^2 
Web site, including childhood and adult<br>
vaccination forms and a sample letter to request records. (By law,<br>
doctors must provide patients with copies of records that they ask for,<br>
though there may be a fee.)<br>
<br>
Bio-Imaging Technologies Inc.'s CapMed unit, which designed one of the<br>
first software programs to let consumers manage their own medical<br>
records, now offers a CD-ROM disk and a portable &quot;personal health key&quot;<br>
that lets users manage and store personal health information and link to<br>
resources via the Web. The health key is a memory device that's small<br>
enough to put on a key chain and can plug into any computer's USB port.<br>
Though most of the data are accessible only with a password, users can<br>
choose information that they want to be accessible in an emergency; that<br>
information will automatically appear when the key is inserted into a<br>
USB port.<br>
<br>
Wendy Angst, general manager of CapMed, likens it to a medical version<br>
of the widely used &quot;Quicken&quot; financial-management software program.<br>
About 400,000 personal-health records have been distributed to consumers<br>
through health plans, but the disks and portable devices can be<br>
purchased from www.capmed.com &lt;<a href="http://65.54.187.250:80/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=069a2a5076783a4fb7f98214524b1014&lat=1091064654&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2ecapmed%2ecom" target="_blank">http://www.capmed.com</a>&gt;^3 
for $30 to<br>
$79.95, depending on the amount of information patients want to store.<br>
Another USB-compatible device, Med-InfoChip, developed by Carl<br>
Franzblau, an associate dean at Boston University's School of Medicine,<br>
costs $44.95 for a one-user version and $99.95 for a device that holds<br>
two medical profiles (www.medinfochip.com &lt;<a href="http://65.54.187.250:80/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=aa2daab5e39262b8dbc3a5155c7f6cbd&lat=1091064654&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2emedinfochip%2ecom" target="_blank">http://www.medinfochip.com</a>&gt;^4 
).<br>
<br>
Web sites that let consumers manage and store their own records include<br>
WebMD's Health Manager subscription service (healthmanager.webmd.com<br>
&lt;<a href="http://65.54.187.250:80/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=b50abae06255e24553f94bd4d4a1ee67&lat=1091064654&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fhealthmanager%2ewebmd%2ecom" target="_blank">http://healthmanager.webmd.com</a>&gt;^5 
), which also offers interactive<br>
health-assessment tools and health-management tools for children and<br>
sends medical news based on topics of interest to users. Its data are<br>
also password-protected, but users can make information available to a<br>
doctor or hospital in an emergency. The service is free for six months<br>
and then costs $29.95 a year. (As always, it is best to read the privacy<br>
policy before entering personal information on any health Web site.)<br>

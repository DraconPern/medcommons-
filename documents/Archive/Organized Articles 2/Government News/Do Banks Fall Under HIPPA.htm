<h3>Health Data Management</h3>
<h3>Do Banks Fall Under HIPAA?</h3>
<p><i><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">By 
Joseph Goedert, News Editor</span></i> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">In recent 
months, banks and other financial institutions have lobbied the Department of 
Health and Human Services to be exempt from requirements under the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Whether 
banks should be considered clearinghouses under HIPAA’s transactions and code 
sets rule—and also governed under the privacy and data security rules—was the 
focus of a recent public hearing sponsored by the National Committee on Vital 
and Health Statistics, which advises HHS on health data issues. The NCVHS 
privacy and confidentiality subcommittee heard testimony from industry experts 
and expects to make recommendations to the full committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The 
question of whether banks fall under HIPAA is important because the banking 
industry—through electronic remittance advice transactions, receivables 
financing arrangements based on claims data, and other services—handles a 
significant amount of protected health information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Further, 
claims clearinghouses fear that enabling banks to process health care 
transactions yet be exempt from HIPAA rules will result in a competitive 
disadvantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
“Clearinghouses have to meet the privacy rule and if banks don’t, that’s not a 
level playing field,” argues Thomas Gilligan, executive director of the 
Association for Electronic Health Care Transactions, a Washington-based trade 
group. “A health care clearinghouse not following the privacy rule is out of 
business and that should just be the cost of doing business for financial 
institutions.” </span></p>
<h4>Different interpretations</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">At the 
crux of the issue is the reluctance of banks to be considered claims 
clearinghouses under HIPAA, meaning they would be covered entities under the 
transactions, privacy and security rules. Gilligan, working with financial 
institutions in the mid-1990s, helped push through a section of HIPAA, Section 
1179, that exempted many activities of financial institutions from HIPAA. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Banks are 
using Section 1179 to argue that they are exempt from requirements of HIPAA when 
handling electronic remittance advice—a HIPAA transaction—because the 
transaction is part of the “payments process” referenced in the section. 
However, HIPAA’s conference report—written during the process in which the U.S. 
House and Senate resolve differences in their different versions of a bill and 
also explain congressional “intent”—states an exemption from HIPAA only exists 
for consumer payment transactions, such as when an individual pays a hospital 
bill by check, credit card or debit card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Enabling 
banks to handle health care transactions outside of HIPAA worries clearinghouses 
and other covered entities that make money from these transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">But it 
also concerns privacy advocates who worry that protected health information 
won’t be adequately secured when banks handle it. If HHS rules banks are not 
subject to HIPAA, large amounts of protected health information could move, 
without full encryption, through the automated clearinghouse network that banks 
use to process transactions, according to Anna Slomovic, a senior fellow at the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“Our 
greatest concern is that automated clearinghouse transactions would be subject 
to data mining for marketing and credit evaluation,” Slomovic told the 
subcommittee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">As 
transactions go through the automated clearinghouse network, “they are captured 
and stored unencrypted in intermediary nodes,” she added. “This is necessary in 
order to trace network problems and verify transaction integrity for financial 
transactions. Unfortunately, this means that protected health information that 
is part of those transactions will be stored as well. This protected health 
information would not be protected by the privacy rule either through direct 
application to covered entities or through business associate contracts.” </span>
</p>
<h4>The other side</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">However, 
financial institutions are not trying to avoid HIPAA’s privacy and security 
requirements, contended J. Steven Stone, senior vice president of PNC Bank in 
Pittsburgh and representing the American Bankers Association and the Electronic 
Payments Association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Both 
associations “are unequivocally opposed” to data mining records of health care 
transactions for medical information, Stone said. Further, he added, financial 
institutions with access to protected health information should be business 
associates under HIPAA, thereby subject to the privacy and security rules.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“Financial 
institutions exist for one reason—because the public trusts us to protect and 
preserve their assets and their information,” Stone told the NCVHS subcommittee. 
“If we fail in that mission, if we violate that trust, we will not be in 
business for long.” • </span></p>

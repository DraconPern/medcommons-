<h2><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">Harvard Pilgrim cooks up a 
'consumer-driven' program</span></h2>
<p class="byline2">By Liz Kowalczyk, Globe Staff &nbsp;|&nbsp; June 27, 2004</p>
<p>When Harvard Pilgrim Health Care launched an unusual new health plan to 
employers in 2002, it fell flat inside the very place that created it: Harvard 
Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Only two of the nonprofit's own employees signed up. And one of them was the 
chief executive, Charles D. Baker.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew why right away,&quot; he said. The plan, called
<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=bostonglobe&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=BBY" target="_new" style="color: #000066; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Best Buy</a> HMO, was far cheaper than the insurer's regular health plans, but 
Harvard Pilgrim -- not its employees -- would enjoy most of the savings from the 
workers who enrolled. &quot;There was no financial reason for anyone to do this,&quot; 
Baker said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Harvard Pilgrim's sales force was busy trying to sell Best Buy to 
employers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Part of a new wave of health plans 
dubbed &quot;consumer-driven,&quot; Best Buy charges employees a high deductible -- $1,000 
for individuals and $2,000 for families -- designed to get enrollees to watch 
more carefully how much they spend on medical care. In return, the monthly 
premium, most of which the company usually covers, is lower than in traditional 
health plans.</p>
<p>Harvard Pilgrim, facing the fourth year of double-digit premium increases for 
its own employees, stood to miss out on an opportunity to trim costs. Besides, 
the insurer needed credibility with its clients. &quot;We wanted to be able to say we 
can help you do this,&quot; Baker said, &quot;because we've done it.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, after a dramatic change in the way Harvard Pilgrim pays for health 
benefits, and an extensive internal campaign called &quot;You Decide&quot; that included 
personal &quot;coaches&quot; for employees, 197 of the insurer's 1,300 employees have 
enrolled in Best Buy.</p>
<p>Harvard Pilgrim won't know if Best Buy has decreased its own employees' use 
of medical services until next year. But the insurer had been predicting 
premiums for its employees would rise 14.5 percent this year. The increased 
enrollment in Best Buy has changed that prediction to 10 percent.</p>
<p>Baker and his sales staff -- most notably in the insurer's annual report -- 
already have begun selling the product based on what they've learned from 
themselves<strong><span style="font-family: Arial">.</span></strong> &quot;We became 
a test lab,&quot; said Beth Cooney, director of Human Resource Operations.</p>
<p>Harvard Pilgrim's experience is a window into consumer-driven healthcare -- 
an experimental arena that some healthcare analysts call the new managed care, 
but that critics warn could lead employees to neglect important medical 
treatment because they're liable for more of the cost.</p>
<p>Many companies, including Harvard Pilgrim, deposit a lump sum into an account 
that employees can draw from to cover part of their deductible.</p>
<p>Even though certain preventive tests like mammograms and routine physicals 
usually are covered and not subject to the deductible, the employee can run into 
higher out-of-pocket costs if he gets sick and uses a lot of medical services.</p>

<p class="byline2">June 27, 2004</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #666666">Page 2 of 3 --</span></b> &quot;It's kind of like 
having a roof with a hole in it,&quot; said Michael Miller, director of health issues 
for Community Catalyst, a national healthcare advocacy group. &quot;It's fine as long 
as itdoesn't rain. If you're healthy, a high-deductible plan works great.&quot;</p>
<p>Miller said there's also a long-term danger: If only healthy people migrate 
to high-deductible plans, leaving sick people in traditional HMOs, premiums for 
the traditional plans could escalate far more.</p>
<p>Consumer-driven health plans grew out of the backlash against traditional 
managed care, in which insurers tightly control costs by denying care they 
believe is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, insurers have loosened the reins, and as a 
result, consumers' use of medical services has soared. This trend, combined with 
the high-cost of new tests and medications, has led to rising premiums.</p>
<p>For 2005, Massachusetts' major insurers are predicting premium increases<strong><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></strong>of 7 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Employers are looking for relief, and insurers are selling consumer-driven 
plans as one answer. The plans are leading to a vast array of new consumer 
information, as insurers post hospital prices and quality measures so members 
can compare before spending their money.</p>
<p>But employers have been slow to pick up the plans, and employees just as slow 
to enroll. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Massachusetts has 26,000 members in its 
high-deductible plans -- about 1 percent of total enrollment.</p>
<p>Tufts, which has just 200 enrollees in its Liberty plan, tweaked the plan 
after surveying its own employees who didn't enroll.</p>
<p>Harvard Pilgrim, which tends to sell more insurance to small companies, which 
have been hit particularly hard by rising costs, has the highest enrollment with 
Best Buy -- 45,000. Still, it represents only about 5 percent of its total 
enrollment, and<strong><span style="font-family: Arial"> </span></strong>Harvard 
Pilgrim hopes it will grow even larger, as an answer to employers' complaints 
about high premiums.</p>
<p>But the problem Harvard Pilgrim faced last spring was how to interest its own 
employees. Employees pick their health plans during a month called &quot;open 
enrollment.&quot; And as Harvard Pilgrim executives planned for the 2003 open 
enrollment it felt like &quot;another ho-hum year,&quot; Cooney said.</p>
<p>But after researching what plans and employers have done in other cities, 
Baker had an idea.</p>
<p>First, he decided to redesign the financial incentives so employees would get 
a big price break for enrolling in Best Buy. Traditionally, Harvard Pilgrim paid 
85 percent of employees' premiums -- no matter what plan they picked. Starting 
this year, the insurer switched to a fixed dollar amount, contributing $300 a 
year toward each individual's premium and $750 a year toward each family's 
premium. Since Best Buy is far cheaper, this means individuals pay just 10 
percent of the total premium, or $32.03 a month, while families pay 13 percent 
or $113.28 a month. But the copayments are usually double that of the regular 
plans.</p>

<p class="byline2">June 27, 2004</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #666666">Page 3 of 3 --</span></b> Employees pay twice 
as much for the regular HMO premiums and nearly five times as much for the most 
expensive point of service<strong><span style="font-family: Arial"> </span>
</strong>plan, in which members do not need referrals for specialists. Both 
these plans have lower copayments and no deductibles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, human resources director Cooney worked on designing an open 
enrollment period that would interest employees. The insurer provided coaches to 
workers who wanted help in figuring out which plan was best for them.</p>
<p>And, it set up an online cost calculator, which allowed employees to compare 
their out-of-pocket expenses for the three different health plans--a tool 
Harvard Pilgrim hopes to offer to its clients. As a result, Harvard Pilgrim 
employees spent one to two hours choosing their health plan compared to minutes 
in previous years.</p>
<p>After calculating her expenses, Jodi Moses, 29, decided Best Buy was worth 
the risk. Under Best Buy, her premium would be lower than in the regular HMO but 
her copayments would be higher -- and she'd be responsible for $500 of the 
$1,000 deductible. Harvard Pilgrim would pay the other half.</p>
<p>Moses estimated that she'd visit the doctor seven times this year and maybe 
visit the emergency room once. She also plugged in a regular monthly 
prescription, her migraine medication, and one extra drug in case she got sick. 
Under this scenario, she'd spend $246 more with Best Buy than with the regular 
HMO. But if she never had to go to the emergency room, she'd spend $204 less.</p>
<p>She decided to take the risk. &quot;When was the last time I was in the ER? I 
can't even remember,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ava Beaulieu's husband, David, was not so bold. Beaulieu, 51, Harvard 
Pilgrim's director of strategic development, wanted to switch from the HMO to 
Best Buy. She and her husband both take high blood pressure medications, and her 
17-year-old son has visited the emergency room several times for sports 
injuries. But otherwise the family is healthy.</p>
<p>She figured her family would save $800 with Best Buy. But her husband 
disagreed with her calculations. He estimated three emergency room visits for 
the family this year compared to her one. In that case, Best Buy would cost them 
an extra $200.</p>
<p>&quot;Why change?&quot; she said. &quot;Best Buy is more complicated. He likes 
predictability.&quot;</p>
<p>Baker, for example, unexpectedly is eating through his $2,000 family 
deductible this year. One of his sons broke his arm skiing, another son spent 
the night in the hospital, and his wife broke her leg walking across an icy 
parking lot.</p>
<p>While the long-term impact of high-deductible plans on costs and employee 
health is unknown, Harvard Pilgrim has undertaken a new marketing campaign to 
persuade more companies to try Best Buy.</p>
<p>For the first time, the insurer's human resources staff is talking to clients 
-- not just its sales staff. It's developed a playful annual report called 
&quot;Eating at Our Own Restaurant.&quot; And it's sending staff to visit companies like 
Life Care Center, a nursing home chain, to help employees work the cost 
calculator.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll be interesting to see if our enrollment in Best Buy grows,&quot; said Ted 
Eliopoulos, director of managed care at Life Care, where nearly one-quarter of 
its 699 Massachusetts employees already are enrolled.</p>

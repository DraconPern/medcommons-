<p><strong>Correction Appended</strong></p>
<p>AS Google's white-hot initial stock offering hogs the headlines, its rivals 
can only gnash their teeth and wonder: How did a couple of Stanford Ph.D. 
dropouts build an outrageously profitable billion-</p>
<p>dollar-a-year company in only five years? </p>
<p>Part of the answer is great Web-search technology. But another part is the 
company's motto: &quot;Don't Be Evil.&quot;</p>

<p>That credo explains why Google's home page is practically empty, because ads 
and graphics would slow dial-up modems. It also explains why Google's ads are 
clearly labeled and separate from search results. Slipping paid-placement links 
into your search results, as MSN and
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=YHOO">
Yahoo</a> do, would be evil.</p>
<p>So six weeks ago, when Google described Gmail, the free e-mail service it is 
testing, the prevailing public reaction was shock. The company said that its 
software would place ads in your incoming messages, relevant to their contents.</p>
<p>It appeared to many people that Google had gone way beyond evil into Big 
Brother land. What could be more sinister than snooping through private 
correspondence looking for advertising opportunities?</p>
<p>Privacy advocates went ballistic. The Electronic Privacy Information Center 
called for Gmail to be shut down, describing it as &quot;an unprecedented invasion 
into the sanctity of private communications.&quot; And a California state senator, 
Liz Figueroa, offered a bill that would make it illegal to scan the contents of 
incoming e-mail. (Never mind that such a bill would make it illegal for 
children's e-mail services to filter out pornographic material.)</p>
<p>Those reactions, as it turns out, are a tad overblown. In fact, no human ever 
looks at the Gmail e-mail. Computers do the scanning - dumbly, robotically and 
with no understanding the words - just the way your current e-mail provider 
scans your messages for spam and viruses. The same kind of software also reads 
every word you type into Google or any other search page, tracks your shopping 
on
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=AMZN">
Amazon</a>, and so on. </p>
<p>Besides, if you're that kind of private, Gmail is the least of your worries. 
You'd better make sure that the people at credit-card companies, mail-order 
outfits and phone companies aren't sitting in back rooms giggling at your 
monthly statements. Heck, how do you know that your current e-mail providers - 
or the administrators of the Internet computers that pass mail along - aren't 
taking an occasional peek?</p>
<p>Still, you feel what you feel. If Gmail creeps you out, just don't sign up.
</p>
<p>That would be a shame, though, because you'd be missing a wonderful thing. 
Even in its current, early state, available only to a few thousand testers, 
Gmail appears destined to become one of the most useful Internet services since 
Google itself.</p>
<p>Like Yahoo Mail and Hotmail, Gmail is a free, Web-based e-mail program, which 
means that you will be able to check or send e-mail from any computer on the 
Internet, wherever you go. Even if you already have a traditional e-mail 
account, a Web mail account makes a great backup.</p>
<p>But otherwise, you wouldn't even peg Gmail as being from the same planet as 
Yahoo and Hotmail. The most important difference is the amount of storage: one 
gigabyte. That's 250 times the amount you get on a free Yahoo account, 500 times 
the amount on Hotmail. </p>
<p>One gigabyte changes everything. You no longer live in terror that somebody 
will send you a photo, thereby exceeding your two-megabyte limit and making all 
subsequent messages bounce back to their senders. You're no longer neurotic 
about checking your mail twice a day just to keep the in-box cleaned out. You 
can let years' worth of e-mail pile up, complete with file attachments (maximum 
size: 10 megabytes each). </p>
<p>One gigabyte means that Gmail can be a handy personal transfer disk. Send 
files to yourself and then retrieve them when you get to the office. Keep 
important pictures or documents in your Gmail account all the time, ready to 
forward when friends request them.</p>
<p>In fact, Google argues that with so much storage, you should get out of the 
habit of deleting messages. Why risk throwing away something that you might need 
again someday? An Archive button moves a message out of the in-box, but it 
remains searchable. Actually deleting a message involves fussing with a pop-up 
menu.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're going to keep all your e-mail around forever, you'd 
better have some pretty good tools for managing it. Fortunately, if anyone can 
tame a vast pile of data, it's Google. Its famous search command works 
brilliantly on your own e-mail, plucking one message out of 5,000 in a fraction 
of a second.</p>
<p>Each message offers a hollow star icon that turns yellow when you click on 
it, to signify anything you like: &quot;Deal with this,&quot; &quot;Those darned in-laws,&quot; or 
whatever. Each row also displays the first line of the message in light-gray 
type, which is a time-saving bit of X-ray vision. </p>
<p>Gmail doesn't have the usual mail folders. Instead, you can flag messages 
with labels of your own choosing. The advantage here is that you can apply 
different labels to a single message, in effect filing it under several 
categories at once. An extremely easy-to-use filter feature lets you flag 
incoming messages with certain labels automatically according to who sends them, 
what's in their subject line and so on.</p>
<p>Yet another clever organizational feature is &quot;conversations,&quot; known to 
computer geeks as threading. Back-and-forth messages on a single topic, even 
among several participants, appear as one entry in your in-box. When opened, the 
exchanges appear like file-folder tabs, which you can expand or collapse 
individually or all at once. </p>
<p>And now, about those ads. </p>
<p>They turn out to be a maximum of three text-only four-line affairs, clearly 
labeled and way off the to the right, just as on Google itself. In my e-mail, a 
message about Earth Day contained an ad for a computer-recycling company. A 
question about music players had two ads for stores selling the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=AAPL">
Apple</a> iPod. In a press release for a computer show, a Linuxworld link 
appeared. </p>
<p>You sometimes get Releated Links beneath the ads, too. Google doesn't get 
money for these; it offers them just to be friendly, and they can sometimes be 
useful indeed. For example, in a message about a coming family vacation, sent 
from my wife downstairs (yes, we're that sort of family), Google offered a link 
to a Web site of restaurant reviews in the resort town we were considering. </p>
<p>Ads appear in fewer than half of my messages; in fact, they seem to appear 
primarily when a capitalized brand name appears in the message. If your 
correspondence is mostly personal stuff (&quot;Miss you guys. How did Casey's toe 
surgery go? Went out to the new vegetarian steakhouse yesterday - great.&quot;), you 
may not see many at all.</p>
<p>The ads are so subtle, so easily ignored, that it's hard to imagine anyone 
preferring the big, blinking, slow-loading graphic ads that appear every time 
you check for messages at the Hotmail and Yahoo Mail sites. Even more 
refreshing, Gmail doesn't turn you into an unpaid billboard for Yahoo or
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=MSFT">
Microsoft</a> (Hotmail's owner) by stamping ads on at the bottom of every 
outgoing message, no matter how sensitive the topic. </p>
<p>Other Gmail features include an excellent spelling checker, a built-in 
address book, auto-complete for addresses, the ability to specify a Reply To 
address (a different e-mail address for replies to your messages), indicators 
(&gt;&gt;) that denote messages sent only to you, in-message photo display, online 
help and one-key shortcuts (C for Compose, R for reply, and so on) that let 
power users cruise through entire e-mail sessions without ever touching the 
mouse. The automatic spam-removal feature is adequate for the moment, but once 
thousands of people begin to use the Report Spam button, Google plans to harness 
the cumulative intelligence of its customers to refine its spam filters in 
innovative ways. </p>
<p>Finally, Google promises that it won't shut down your account until you go 
nine months without using it. (Hotmail and Yahoo delete all your mail and 
recycle your address after only 30 days). Now that's not being evil.</p>
<p>Google hasn't said when, exactly, Gmail's testing period will end and the 
service will go live.</p>
<p>That's just as well, because there are a few items that should still be on 
its To Do list: compatibility with Apple's Safari browser (at the moment, it 
works on on the Mac, Windows and Linux versions of Mozilla, Firefox and Netscape 
7.1, plus Internet Explorer for Windows ), for example, and a signature feature 
that stamps your name on each outgoing message. It would be nice if you could 
use regular e-mail readers like Outlook Express to check your Gmail, as you can 
withHotmail. A certain audience will miss the ability to format outgoing 
messages with fonts, styles and colors, too.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Gmail is infinitely cleaner, faster, more useful, more efficient, 
less commercial and less limiting than other Web-based e-mail services. Once 
Gmail goes live, Hotmail and Yahoo won't know what hit them. </p>
<p>The only population likely not to be delighted by Gmail are those still 
uncomfortable with those computer-generated ads. Those people are free to ignore 
or even bad-mouth Gmail, but they shouldn't try to stop Google from offering 
Gmail to the rest of us. We know a good thing when we see it. </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
      <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Over the 
      past months we have heard about how free and open source software (FOSS) 
      is becoming more and more acceptable in the business community. There has 
      also been a movement to have governments adopt policies that open the door 
      to FOSS. However, it appears that the open source community has overlooked 
      one vital area of the community that would most likely embrace FOSS with 
      open arms, and that is the area of emergency services (Police, Fire and 
      Emergency Medical Services).</span> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
      Like any government agency, emergency service agencies need the basic 
      office software, but they also need 'specialized' software, such as 
      Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems, 9-1-1 Call Taking systems, incident 
      reporting systems, etc. Today, almost without exception, every agency is 
      forced to use a proprietary, closed source Windows program. Far too often 
      it is purchased from a company that is no longer in business five years 
      after the purchase, resulting in the need to purchase a replacement 
      product from another vendor. Lastly, because the software is proprietary, 
      the agencies that are able to purchase it cannot do everything they want 
      or need the software to do, nor can they modify it to meet their needs.
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The current 
      availability of FOSS for emergency services is extremely limited. As part 
      of a very quick, non-scientific study, we did a search on the
      <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" style="color: #5E741C; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
      Sourceforge</a> web site for software that is geared towards emergency 
      services. We chose Sourceforge as they host 78,324 projects (as of 25 
      March 2004), all of them open source (They also host our recently started 
      open source project,
      <a href="http://pad-prg-mgt.sourceforge.net" style="color: #5E741C; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
      PAD Program Management</a>). We did a search under four terms; 
      &quot;ambulance,&quot; &quot;emergency,&quot; &quot;fire,&quot; and &quot;police.&quot; We only found 20 projects 
      (&lt; 0.03% of total projects). Of these, only five had released any form of 
      software, and only two were believed to be considered stable releases.
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As an EMT/Paramedic 
      for over 20 years, I have seen computers make their way into the field, 
      frequently with mixed results. The current proprietary software options 
      are often very limited and very expensive, making it inaccessible to many 
      small and volunteer departments (which serve the majority of the country). 
      This relative high cost has a very real effect on the communities served.
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Consider the 
      dilemma faced by a small EMS agency that has five ambulances, of which two 
      are staffed by paramedics. As a medical director, do I purchase a high 
      dollar software program to allow my medics to electronically enter an 
      incident report, or do I purchase a new EKG monitor-defibrillator (a 
      machine that looks at the heart's rhythm and can deliver an electrical 
      charge to a quivering heart)? You can almost be assured that the 
      defibrillator will be purchased each and every time. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The problem is by 
      not having a low cost software option, billing accuracy will likely suffer 
      resulting in loss of income. I can't easily look at the response data that 
      will tell me where and how my units are being used, so I can't go to the 
      local town council to lobby for an additional ambulance or funding for 
      training. I can't easily tell where my medics are having deficiencies in 
      their ability to provide care. I can't do a simple query to have all chest 
      pain charts reviewed, instead I have to review every paper report to first 
      see if it is a chest pain incident, then set those on the side to be 
      reviewed later. All of this is a long, tedious, labor intensive effort.
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The emergency 
      service community is currently at the mercy of the proprietary software 
      firms. This has an impact far more reaching than the limited scenario 
      outlined above. Another impact area is the inability of emergency service 
      agencies to share data. Let me offer an insight into this problem by 
      sharing my experiences with a program I am working on. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Currently I am 
      assisting another paramedic who is tracking Public Access to 
      Defibrillation (PAD) programs for a large metropolitan area. In a PAD 
      program, an office building, school, work place, or other public area has 
      had Automated Defibrillators (AEDs) installed. AEDs are used by the lay 
      public to help victims of sudden cardiac arrest, prior to the arrival of 
      EMS. Because of their ease of use and rapid accessibility, areas that have 
      installed AEDs and have used them within 5 minutes of collapse of the 
      victim have seen successful resuscitation rates as high as 50% (AHA &quot;Heartsaver 
      AED for the Lay Rescuer and First Responder,&quot; page 1-8). They are a 
      probably the single greatest improvement in emergency health care since 
      the advent of EMS. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">AEDs have an 
      onboard computer that is able to analyze the victims EKG, and provide the 
      electrical shock if needed. The computer provides voice prompts to the 
      user on when to start and stop CPR. It also records the EKG, the time an 
      analyzation was performed and what rhythm was recognized by the computer, 
      the times of the voice prompts, etc. Also, it keeps a record of each time 
      the unit performed its own internal diagnostic check, the time the machine 
      was turned on, as well as turned off, and more. All of this information is 
      available to the oversight agency by simply downloading the information 
      from the AED's internal memory into a software program/database. </span>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As part of a 
      community PAD program, there is usually legislation that mandates a 
      specific government agency provide oversight to the program. This agency 
      will typically have to track where AEDS are located, how often they are 
      used, and how well they are working. This oversight agency typically 
      cannot dictate to the individual purchaser which vendor they must utilize 
      when buying the AED. In an area such as the one I work in, you may have 
      well over a dozen vendors selling their machines to schools, businesses, 
      public transportation authorities, local and federal government agencies, 
      etc. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Here is where the 
      problem comes in. Each of these vendors has their own proprietary 
      software. None of the software is compatible with any other vendor's 
      software. Further there are no common standards to export the data. If you 
      are responsible for monitoring a PAD program in your community, you may 
      have six, eight, ten or more software programs in which to download AED 
      information, of which none can exchange information. The result is the 
      inability to tell just how well your PAD program is working. You have 
      plenty of data, but you can't use it the way the you want. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The FOSS community 
      has been very good at developing open standards for other items of 
      hardware and software. There is no doubt that the same could be done here, 
      if the FOSS community were to get involved. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I firmly believe 
      that the FOSS community is missing a golden opportunity by not getting 
      involved with the emergency service community. Imagine a FOSS distribution 
      geared towards EMS, Fire or Police Departments. In addition to the typical 
      programs such as KDE, Gnome, Open Office, MySQL, and Apache, there would 
      be a Departmental Database that tracked personnel and equipment within the 
      agency, a Fire Incident Reporting System based on the National Fire 
      Service Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) standard, an EMS incident and 
      billing system, a training database, etc. Is this really that much 
      different from many of the business distributions that it cannot be 
      accomplished? </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In conclusion, by 
      working with the emergency service community, the FOSS community would 
      provide a service that is truly valuable to their local community. Open 
      standards would allow efficient data collection and sharing, resulting in 
      improved responses to the local community. Money saved from high priced, 
      proprietary software could then be used to purchase protective equipment 
      for those who provide the front line service, and life saving equipment 
      for paramedics to use could be purchased. This would be an area that the 
      FOSS community could publicize as a true, tangible benefit to using Open 
      Source Software in the local community. There is little to nothing the 
      closed source, proprietary software companies could say in rebuttal.
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">My hope is that 
      soon there will be the start a dialog of the 'movers and shakers' in the 
      FOSS community who see the value in working with emergency services 
      community. Will open source come to the rescue of emergency services? Only 
      time will tell. </span></p>

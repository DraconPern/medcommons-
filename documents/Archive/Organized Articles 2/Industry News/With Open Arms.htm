<h2><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">Hub firms embrace software 
that rivals Windows system</span></h2>
<p class="byline2">By Robert Weisman, Globe Staff, 4/7/2004</p>
<p>Open source software is flowering this spring in Greater Boston. Companies 
are distributing, writing programs for, investing in, and profiting from, the 
free computer software that is emerging as an alternative to proprietary systems 
like Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>Red Hat Inc., the leading distributor of the Linux open source computer 
operating system, has designated its Westford site a ''center of competency,&quot; in 
effect its development hub. Red Hat plans to add about two dozen jobs there this 
spring and another 55 by the end of the year. Employment at Westford, the 
company's second-largest site after its Raleigh, N.C., headquarters, already has 
doubled to about 120 in the past 18 months, with another 10 engineers from a Red 
Hat customer, Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., collaborating there on server applications.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, high-tech survivor Novell Inc., which recently moved its corporate 
offices to Waltham from Provo, Utah, is remaking itself as an open source 
company. Novell is readying the Mono project, an open source version of 
Microsoft's .NET development platform, for shipment in June. It's also digesting 
acquisitions of open source pioneer Ximian Inc. of Boston and Germany's SUSE 
Linux AG, a Red Hat rival.</p>
<p>Boston area venture capital firms are jumping on the open source bandwagon, 
funding companies that are experimenting with new business models based on 
packaging, servicing, and supporting free computer software rather than the 
traditional software licensing model. And a growing number of area software 
companies are writing programs that run on Linux as well as proprietary systems, 
or ''blending&quot; open source and proprietary elements in developing applications 
-- a mix-and-match strategy that was uncommon just five years ago.</p>
<p>It all may be adding up to another technology boomlet for the Boston area, 
the birthplace of the Free Software Foundation, which launched the open source 
movement almost 20 years ago. The movement now is as global as the technology 
that spawned it. But if it had an intellectual capital, it would be Boston.</p>
<p>''Any time a major technology consolidates in an area, that's good for the 
area,&quot; said veteran technologist Dan Bricklin, whose Newton firm, Software 
Garden, is pursuing a ''cross-platform&quot; approach. ''To have representatives from 
all the companies doing open source, and to even have some headquarters moving 
here, that's a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation was formed in 1985 by self-described ''hacker&quot; 
Richard Stallman, then a researcher at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab, to 
develop a nonproprietary software system called GNU. Under a general public 
license, everyone can download, copy, modify, and distribute GNU's open source 
software. But all code is shared freely, no one can charge for the software, and 
there are no restrictions on redistribution. ''One of the things we've been 
trying to bring to the foreground is the idea that free software is related to 
free speech,&quot; said Peter Brown, the license compliance manager and one of 11 
staffers at the nonprofit Free Software Foundation in Boston.</p>
<p>The open source operating system Linux, created by Linus Torvolds at 
Finland's University of Helsinki in 1991, was the ''kernal&quot; of code at the heart 
of the GNU system that let all its applications talk to one another. With the 
spread of Linux in the 1990s, open source software gained a following among 
computer scientists and technology-oriented college students who saw it as a 
no-frills alternative to Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., 
and other makers of proprietary systems. But it wasn't until 1999, when IBM 
Corp. said it would support Linux, that the open source movement began to pick 
up momentum among technology users in large enterprises.</p>
<p>Linux distributors, such as Red Hat and SUSE, make their money not by 
licensing the operating system but by selling tailored packages of software, 
maintenance, and updates. As they have made inroads, mostly in the enterprise 
server market, Microsoft, the Redmond, Wash.-based software colossus, has 
responded by attempting to sell customers on the overall value and business 
advantages of the Windows environment.</p>
<p>''When people buy an operating system, the applications are really driving 
the sale,&quot; said Michael J. Kosek, general manager for Microsoft's New England 
district, whose company sponsors large developer events in the region. ''If you 
look at it from that perspective, you still have a lot more applications on the 
Windows platform and a lot more developers developing for the Windows platform.&quot;</p>
<p>But open source competitors are trying to tap into the same rich vein of 
local developers. At a jobs fair in Cambridge last month, Red Hat's president 
and chief executive, Matthew J. Szulik, addressed more than 200 prospective 
employees and Linux users, some drawn by postings on Meetup.com, a free website 
that organizes local gatherings. (The technique helped Red Hat draw similarly 
large crowds at recent events in Japan, Australia, and California.) ''You've got 
that great legacy from Digital Equipment, that great talent pool here,&quot; Szulik, 
a New Bedford native, said before the Cambridge event.</p>
<p>At Novell, open source is now at the heart of a broad strategy that 
incorporates everything from moving all its technologies to Linux, to supporting 
GNOME, the graphical desktop environment that runs on Linux, to boosting the 
North American sales of SUSE, the German distributor that has its strongest 
market penetration in Europe.</p>
<p>''We're very excited about Linux as a platform we can grow our business 
around and on top of,&quot; said David Patrick, the Novell vice president and general 
manager who had been Ximian's chief executive. ''If you've got open source 
companies like Novell, Ximian, and Red Hat here in Boston, this is the future. 
Boston's always had a strong software community. There's a lot of stuff 
happening here. It's not going to happen in Redmond. They're not great fans of 
open source.&quot;</p>
<p>Even in the venture capital world, which long viewed alternative software 
models skeptically, interest has been piqued by the new comfort with Linux in 
corporate information technology departments. Greylock Ventures of Waltham is a 
backer of Red Hat, while Matrix Partners, also of Waltham, last month led a 
funding round for JBoss Group, a free software and professional services company 
in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Within the software community in Greater Boston, many developers are using 
both open source and proprietary platforms to write their programs. ''Today, the 
first question you ask is, 'Is there something good in open source that we can 
use?' &quot; said Michael D. Kinkead, president and chief executive of TIMEblaster 
Corp. in Boston, which is developing software to help biomedical scientists do 
online research. ''We absolutely would not have asked that question five years 
ago.&quot;</p>

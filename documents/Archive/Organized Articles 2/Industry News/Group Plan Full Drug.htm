organization of top medical journals is considering a proposal that would 
require drug makers to register clinical trials at their start in a public 
database in order for results, whether successful or not, to be later considered 
for publication, according to three people working with the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">
Pharmaceutical companies are not generally required now to disclose results of a 
trial or even whether one was conducted. Some academic researchers have long 
argued that fuller registries of drug trials are needed because companies, as 
well as medical journals and scientists, tend to spotlight only trials that show 
positive results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The plan, 
if adopted by the organization, the International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors, is likely to put pressure on pharmaceutical makers to disclose more 
about the trials they run. The group includes 12 major medical journals like The 
Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of 
Medicine, The Lancet and The Annals of Internal Medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The recent 
discussion among the journal editors about a trial registry comes amid public 
controversy about clinical trial data after the disclosures that the results of 
antidepressant tests in children were not adequately publicized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Because the 
medical journals in the group are prestigious, and publication of the results of 
a clinical trial in them carries much weight, companies frequently use articles 
from them as marketing tools to persuade doctors to prescribe a drug. If the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors adopts the proposal for a 
registry, drug companies not wanting to participate could still seek to have 
their research published in other less-prominent medical journals, but the 
research might not get as much attention from physicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">A spokesman 
for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America, a 
group representing drug makers, said it was not aware of the proposal being 
considered by medical journal editors to require registration of trials, so it 
could not comment on it. In the past, the group has not supported a registry, 
although a few companies have adopted a registry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Many drug 
companies without registries have noted that they voluntarily disclose the 
results of all clinical trials they conduct, either at scientific conferences or 
through publications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">But critics 
say that there is no central registry where clinical trials and their results 
are available, making it difficult for researchers to track all studies that 
have been done on a single drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Ideally, 
advocates of clinical trial registries say, such databases would show when a 
trial was started, list its objectives and then update that information with the 
trial's results or the reason it was terminated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">A proposal 
to mandate trial registration as a prerequisite for publication was discussed 
last week at a meeting of the journal editors' group, said the three people 
working with the organization who insisted on anonymity because, they said, the 
proposal was still under discussion and because the group was not planning to 
announce any change unless it was adopted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">A decision 
could come in the summer, one person said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">In a 
related development, policy makers at the American Medical Association, which 
represents many of the nation's doctors, are expected to vote as early as today 
on a proposal that would urge the government to create a public registry of 
clinical trials and their results, a spokesman for the A.M.A. said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Yesterday,
<a href="javascript:Filtered()" target="_blank" style="font-family: Tahoma; color: #000099; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">
GlaxoSmithKline</a>, the manufacturer of the antidepressant Paxil, released on 
its company Web site the reports of clinical tests of that drug in children and 
adolescents suffering from psychological conditions including depression. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The action 
follows a civil lawsuit filed this month by the New York State attorney general, 
Eliot Spitzer, that accused the company of misleading doctors by publicizing a 
favorable study of Paxil for pediatric depression while playing down other 
trials that showed the drug did not work better than a placebo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">
GlaxoSmithKline officials have denied that they selectively disclosed trial 
findings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Regulators 
in this country and elsewhere are now scrambling to review unpublished test data 
on Paxil and several other popular antidepressants to see if the drugs pose 
dangers.</span></p>

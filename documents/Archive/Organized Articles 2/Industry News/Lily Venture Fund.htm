Does It Pay to Manage Your Own Care?</span></h1>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">New York Times 
Full Feed via NewsEdge Corporation : CONSUMER-DRIVEN health care, embraced by 
some employers as a way to contain medical costs, sounds so sensible: Educate 
workers about health care expenses and give them a financial stake in managing 
their own care, through individual cash accounts. Each year, employers deposit 
money in these accounts, which can be used for doctor's visits, prescription 
drugs and other medical expenses. Any remaining money may be rolled over to the 
next year.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">By making 
employees active participants in managing their own care, they will spend more 
cautiously, and medical costs will naturally come down. At least that's the 
theory.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Only a tiny 
fraction of employers offer these plans, which typically also include a 
high-deductible insurance plan that kicks in once the fund is exhausted. So it 
is too soon to know whether costs will actually decline. But some health care 
experts are skeptical.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">They're just a way 
to make higher patient cost-sharing more attractive to employees, said Paul B. 
Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health-System Change, a 
nonpartisan policy research group based in Washington.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">There is no 
question that employees are already paying more. In 2003, on average, they paid 
58 percent of the premium for family coverage in preferred-provider organization 
plans, up from 53 percent the year before, and 57 percent of premiums for health 
maintenance organization plans, compared with 50 percent in 2002, according to 
survey results released last month by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. The 
median out-of-pocket maximum for P.P.O. care within the network climbed to 
$2,000 from $1,500, according to the survey, and a third of employers required a 
co-payment of $20 or more for H.M.O. office visits, up from just 22 percent the 
year before.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Some health care 
experts and consumer advocates worry that throwing a pot of money at people and 
telling them to go manage their health is no cure for the system's ills. Won't 
poorer, sicker employees, they ask, be paying much more for care?</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">The pivot is going 
to be designing consumer-driven health plans such that if people make 
high-quality, efficient choices, they actually pay less, said Dr. Arnold 
Milstein, a consultant for Mercer Human Resource Consulting and the medical 
director for the Pacific Business Group on Health, an association of large 
California employers.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Health care 
experts say some employers and insurers are taking promising steps toward making 
the consumer-driven model work. A handful of companies began testing the waters 
about three years ago.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Destiny Health of 
Oak Brook, Ill., offers a consumer-driven plan with a $600 personal medical 
account for singles, combined with a preferred-provider organization insurance 
plan that has a deductible of $1,000. To encourage people with chronic medical 
conditions to take the medications they need rather than hoard the money in 
their accounts, Destiny divides costs into controllable and uncontrollable 
buckets. If you have any of 110 or so chronic medical conditions that are deemed 
as having uncontrollable costs -- like diabetes, heart disease, asthma or high 
cholesterol -- the cost of medication for them comes out of insurance instead of 
your personal account.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">About a year ago, 
the Ferguson Financial Group in Pecatonica, Ill., began offering a Destiny 
Health plan. It absolutely makes a difference, said Judy Meinders, 58, a 
customer service representative at the company, of the plan's chronic-medication 
benefit. Ms. Meinders says she has to take two pills a day to control her 
thyroid disease and high blood pressure.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Destiny Health 
also offers incentives to help employees make healthy choices. Workers earn 
points for getting flu shots, taking exercise classes or discussing chronic 
conditions with a nurse. The points can be redeemed for airline tickets, hotel 
accommodations and health club memberships, among other things.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Other companies 
also offer incentives. Plans designed by Lumenos of Alexandria, Va., an 
administrator of consumer-driven plans, might add $100 to someone's health 
account for filling out a health questionnaire or talking with a health coach to 
manage chronic conditions. At Anthem Blue Cross, which offers plans in nine 
states, employees can receive discounts on Jenny Craig weight-loss programs.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Keeping costs 
within the reach of lower-paid workers is a concern. One relatively simple 
solution is to link what employees pay to their salaries.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Rockwell 
Automation, an industrial automation company based in Milwaukee, has 17,000 
employees in the United States, from factory workers to senior executives. An 
employee earning $35,000 a year with family coverage who signs up for the 
company's consumer-driven health plan has a $1,700 deductible and a maximum 
annual out-of-pocket cost of $2,500. Someone who earns $85,000 and buys the same 
family coverage, however, faces a $3,100 deductible and a $5,000 out-of-pocket 
maximum.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Initially, you do 
get some pushback from higher-paid employees when you implement this, said Roger 
Freitag, the company's director of global benefits.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">Tiered networks, 
in which providers are grouped into tiers based on cost or efficiency, are also 
being adopted by some employers and insurers. Consumers pay more or less 
depending on the tier they choose.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">The tiered 
networks have the potential to help direct consumers to more efficient and 
better providers through financial incentives that actually give people more 
choice, said Gary Claxton, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, based 
in Menlo Park, Calif.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">BUT most tiering 
has been rudimentary. Some plans, for example, lump all teaching hospitals into 
a high-cost tier and community hospitals into a low-cost tier, or base the 
distinctions on costs for specific procedures. These measures, however, do not 
really deal with the cost of treating a patient through the course of an 
illness.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">A few plans, like 
Premera Blue Cross in Seattle, are beginning to address this. Premera puts 
doctors into tiers based on their clinics' relative cost efficiency in treating 
particular conditions or diseases. That way, a doctor who charges more could 
still be in the preferred tier if he is better at avoiding complications or 
reducing unnecessary lab tests. Premera is developing ways to measure quality 
and patient satisfaction as well.</span></p>
<p style="background: white"><span style="font-family: Arial">They've realized 
it's a mistake to judge a doctor based on fees, because he may be more 
cost-effective, Dr. Milstein said.</span></p>

    1. NEW LILLY VENTURE FUND TO INVEST IN DEVELOPING MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY<br>
    Lilly Ventures, the pharmco's corporate venture division, says it launched a 
    third venture capital fund, Lilly MedTech. The fund will provide resources 
    -- up to $5 million per company -- and industry knowledge to companies 
    developing technological advances in the medical field. Lilly MedTech will 
    initially focus on diagnostics, therapeutic devices, and combination 
    products incorporating pharmaceuticals and medical devices and/or 
    diagnostics. Lilly Ventures now has $175 million under management among its 
    three venture funds. Lilly BioVentures concentrates on early-stage 
    biotechnology and drug development start-up companies, and e.Lilly Venture 
    Fund seeks to boost early-to-development-stage e-business startups. <br>

    2. FDA MOVES TO THWART TEXAS COMPANIES' DRUG-IMPORTATION EFFORTS<br>
    The FDA sent warning letters to three companies in Temple, Texas, notifying 
    them that their Canadian drug importation program is illegal and that the 
    agency may take legal action. The three run an import program for employees 
    and retirees of the City of Montgomery, Ala. The companies are pharmacy 
    benefits manager Expedite-Rx, insurance claims processor SPC Global 
    Technologies, and insurer Employer Health Options. According to the FDA, 
    Expedite-Rx does not hold a Texas pharmacy license, and the PBM was asked by 
    the Texas State Board of Pharmacy to discontinue operations last July. The 
    warning letters are the latest enforcement action by the agency to curb drug 
    imports. Last year, the FDA shut down Rx Depot, a U.S.-based chain of 
    storefront Rx drug importers (ePharm5 11/7/03). <br>

    3. PHARMCOS SPEARHEADING PROBE INTO PRODUCTION OF COUNTERFEIT DRUGS<br>
    Pharmco-backed investigations are targeting several European countries as 
    primary large-scale producers of counterfeit Rx medications, the Independent 
    on Sunday (IoS) reports. The countries -- Poland, Bulgaria, and Turkey -- 
    all are on the verge of joining the European Union. Leading authorities, 
    such as the World Health Organization, predict an increase in counterfeit 
    activity due to less regulatory control in newer E.U. member countries, and 
    the Internet offers counterfeiters a larger market to sell their goods. 
    Pfizer has already succeeded in shutting down three counterfeit Viagra 
    factories abroad after finding fake pills in Poland, Russia, and Bulgaria. A 
    recent exposé by the IoS led to the shutdown of British-run website 
    paypill.com, for selling fake Viagra and attempting to pass it off as the 
    authentic product (ePharm5 1/22/04). <br>

    Clemens Family Markets in suburban Philadelphia will become the first 
    supermarket chain to roll out Healthnotes' EasyAnswer Touchscreen kiosks. 
    Healthnotes says the kiosks were specifically designed for retail use, with 
    visuals and built-in user instructions. They will be deployed in 20 of 
    Clemens' 21 stores and will run Healthnotes Healthy Living, which includes 
    information on topics such as nutrition, weight control, and health 
    supplements. Clemens also added Healthnotes Healthy Living to its website, 
    clemensmarkets.com. <br>

    5. NYTIMES: CONSUMER-DRIVEN HEALTHCARE INFLUENCING PATIENTS AND DOCS<br>
    The concept of consumer-driven healthcare, where employees manage at least 
    some of their own healthcare dollars, is starting to have some influence on 
    the healthcare marketplace, according to an article in The New York Times. 
    Since only a small number of employees offer these plans, it is still too 
    early to tell if the plans will effectively cut healthcare costs. But, the 
    report points out that some employers are taking steps toward making the 
    consumer-driven model work. Companies are offering employees incentives such 
    as airline points for participating in preventative health activities. 
    Consumer-driven health plans are also influencing provider selection, as 
    health plans are enacting a tiered system for physicians based on the 
    quality of the care they provide and charging members more to see top-tier 
    physicians. <br>

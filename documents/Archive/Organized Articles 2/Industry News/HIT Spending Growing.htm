HEALTHCARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING IS GROWING RAPIDLY<br>
<br>
Chicago, IL, November 19, 2003 – The Healthcare Information Technology (H.I.T.) 
market in 2003 is forecasted to grow at a rate of 9.3% to $23.6 billion from 
$21.6 billion spent in 2002 as the H.I.T. market continues to out-perform all 
other segments of the technology industry, according to Sheldon I. Dorenfest &amp; 
Associates, Ltd., a Chicago-based provider of H.I.T. market data. <br>
<br>
Fueled by the desire to reduce medical errors and improve clinical work 
processes, the H.I.T. market is flourishing again. H.I.T. market growth is led 
by PACS and CPOE buying and followed by the purchase of other clinical 
information systems such as computerized patient record, pharmacy, surgery, 
emergency department, radiology, and document management systems. With a strong 
fourth quarter of accelerated buying to finish the year, 2003 will be the best 
H.I.T. market growth year since 1999. Dorenfest &amp; Associates, Ltd. forecasts 
that H.I.T. market growth will continue at about 9% per year for the next three 
years with H.I.T. market spending expected to grow to $30.5 billion by the end 
of 2006. (See Figure 1).</span></p>

    <br>
    &quot;Results from over 1,000 healthcare delivery systems and almost 2,500 
    hospitals interviewed to date for THE 2003 DORENFEST INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE 
    DELIVERY SYSTEM (IHDS +) DATABASE™ indicate a big jump in buying across all 
    application areas,&quot; said Sheldon I. Dorenfest, CEO, Dorenfest &amp; Associates. 
    &quot;Patient safety issues are paramount in the minds of senior management teams 
    who are turning to I.T. software solutions to help them reduce medical 
    errors throughout their organizations,&quot; Dorenfest continued.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;PACS systems are showing the most dramatic growth with over 30% of the 
    hospitals interviewed in 2003 now using a PACS system, and over half of 
    these hospitals purchasing PACS within the past two years. During the next 
    two years, another 40% of the nation's hospitals will be purchasing a PACS 
    system,&quot; said Dorenfest. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;CPOE systems showed similar trends. In 2001, less than 1% of the nation's 
    hospitals were using CPOE systems in which most of the physicians were 
    entering most of their own orders into the computer systems. At the present 
    time, almost 15% of the hospitals in the nation are in the process of 
    implementing a CPOE system. Over 50% of the remaining hospitals are 
    evaluating their strategy toward CPOE, and many of them will be buying such 
    systems in the next three years,&quot; Dorenfest continued. &quot;Other clinical 
    systems including CPR, emergency department, pharmacy, surgery, radiology, 
    document management, and a variety of other clinical and financial systems 
    were also driving market growth,&quot; said Dorenfest.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;While H.I.T. system purchases outpace prior expectations, there continues 
    to be a growing work process problem within healthcare organizations. The 
    cumulative impact of poorly implemented past system purchases has caused the 
    industry to create a wide variety of convoluted, tangled, and redundant work 
    processes. With this additional clinical systems buying, there is a 
    possibility that work processes will deteriorate further unless 
    implementation approaches are improved,&quot; said Dorenfest. &quot;Significant 
    emphasis must be placed on simplifying and improving work flow by reducing 
    redundant, convoluted, and tangled work processes during the implementation 
    of these new systems,&quot; said Dorenfest. &quot;This presents a tremendous 
    opportunity for the industry, and H.I.T. vendors are taking different 
    approaches to packaging and delivering their products in the healthcare 
    market place. By emphasizing process improvement services to support the 
    implementation of their software, healthcare suppliers will be more 
    successful and make their healthcare customers better users of their 
    information systems products,&quot; says Dorenfest.<br>

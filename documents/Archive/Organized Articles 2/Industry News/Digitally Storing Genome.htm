The ability to digitally store, and search, personal genetic data</span></h1>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">THE GUARDIAN 
via NewsEdge Corporation : Nowadays, we google reflexively: spellings, song 
lyrics, company telephone numbers, hot gossip on today's five-minute 
celebrities, guilty secrets of prospective partners and - most fascinating of 
all - ourselves. But alongside the dramatic changes Google has wrought in our 
relationship to the world of external data, a parallel revolution is taking 
place in a more personal sphere: the human genome - the totality of genetic 
information that defines a large part of who we are.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The internet 
search engines of Google and its predecessors - Lycos, Infoseek, AltaVista - 
became our indispensable guides as the world's memory was converted from 
traditional analogue forms such as books, newspapers, magazines and microfilms 
to purely digital web pages. This enabled standard text-search techniques to be 
scaled up to unprecedented levels - the secret of Google's success is as much 
one of quantity as quality.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">That same 
transition from analogue to digital has occurred in the world of molecular 
biology. Watson and Crick's famous double helix not only provided a structure 
for DNA, but turned the inheritance it mediated from a chemical system into an 
informational one. The data is stored as a sequence of molecules usually written 
as A, C, G and T. It turns out that the digital code of life is written not in 
binary (0 and 1), as with computers, but uses a completely equivalent 
representation based on four elements.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">It was 
precisely 50 years after Watson and Crick's breakthrough of 1953 that the 
listing of the 3bn letters of our digital program was first elucidated. The 
international Human Genome Project took 15 years of intensive work at a cost of 
some $3bn (though this includes related projects). The result was not the genome 
of any one person, but a kind of mosaic of several anonymous individuals. For 
research purposes, this is fine. Powerful programs from the new field of 
bioinformatics - the marriage of computers and molecular biology - allow 
important general structures such as the genes that code for proteins, the basic 
building blocks of our bodies, to be spotted there, as well as the special 
variants whose presence predisposes us to disease.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">If the genome 
were to refer to just one person, those same bioinformatics tools could be 
deployed to explore not what we have in common, but what makes each of us unique 
- the equivalent of typing your own name into Google, rather than carrying out a 
search for a neutral general term.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">For this to be 
possible, the cost of sequencing the human genome needs to drop enormously. With 
a dozen companies racing towards the goal of the sub-$1,000 genome, the day when 
your DNA is sequenced and burnt on to a CD-Rom for roughly the cost of a 
conventional health checkup is not far off.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">In fact, the 
personal genome is a kind of total health checkup - one that includes all 
possible genetic diseases, known and unknown. The result of every test available 
- for susceptibilities to various cancers, for example - would be revealed after 
a little genomic googling on your home computer. As new genetic tests are 
devised, the results could be read off from your digital code without the need 
for further medical examinations.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The ready 
availability of results for every genetic test, present and future, is a mixed 
blessing. Currently, you only carry out a particular test when you want the 
results - presumably when you have thought through the implications. Once 
personal genomes are available, all the facts about your susceptibility to 
medical conditions are there waiting for you on the CD-Rom, whether you want 
them or not. It is already hard enough for people at risk to decide whether to 
take a test for illnesses, such as Huntington's, that are currently incurable, 
since nothing can be done in the event of a positive result. Personal genomes 
will deepen the quandary.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">There is an 
important social dimension, too. Some serious medical conditions such as cystic 
fibrosis or Tay-Sachs disease occur when both parents pass on a particular 
variant of a gene to their child. These are known as autosomal recessive 
disorders. It is quite common for those with relatives affected by such diseases 
to take genetic tests to establish whether they carry these vari ants; those 
with the variant gene may decide not to have children if they marry another 
carrier - or perhaps only to marry someone who is not.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Consider a 
not-too-distant future in which personal genomes are readily available. For 
those with relations affected by a serious medical condition, this will 
conveniently provide them with any genetic test they need. But it will also 
offer the rest of us information about our status for these and other, far less 
serious, autosomal recessive disorders that might similarly manifest themselves 
in children if we married a fellow carrier.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">A 
bioinformatics program running on a PC could easily check our genomes for all 
genes associated with the autosomal recessive disorders that had been identified 
so far. Regular software updates downloaded from the internet - like those for 
anti-virus programs - would keep our search software abreast of the latest 
medical research. The question is, how potentially serious does a variant gene's 
effects have to be for us to care about its presence in our DNA? Down to what 
level should we be morally obliged to tell our prospective partners - or have 
the right to ask about?</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">And just when 
is the appropriate moment to swap all these delicate DNA details? Before getting 
married? Before going to bed together? Before even exchanging words? Will there 
one day be a new class of small, wireless devices that hold our personal genomic 
profile in order to carry out discreet mutual compatibility checks on nearby 
potential partners: a green light for genomic joy, a red one for excessive 
recessive risks?</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Given the 
daunting complexity of the ethical issues raised by knowing the digital code of 
life in detail, many may opt for the simplest option: not to google it. But even 
if you refuse to delve within your genome, there are plenty of others who will 
be keen to do so. Employers and insurance companies would doubtless love to scan 
your data before giving you a job or issuing a policy. And if your children and 
grandchildren have any inconvenient or expensive medical condition that they 
have inherited from one side of the family, they might like to know which - not 
least, to ensure that they sue the right person.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Another group 
that is likely to be deeply interested in googling your genome are the law 
enforcement agencies. Currently, DNA is used to match often microscopic samples 
found at the scene of a crime, for example, with those taken from suspects, by 
comparing special, short regions of it - DNA fingerprints. The better the match, 
the more likely it is that they came from the same individual. Low-cost 
sequencing technologies would allow DNA samples to be analysed completely - not 
just to give patterns for matching, but even rough indications of physical and 
mental characteristics - convenient for rounding up suspects. This is a rather 
hit-and-miss approach, though, where success depends on pulling in the right 
people. How much more convenient it would be if everyone's DNA were already to 
hand, allowing a simple text matching process to find the guilty party.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">This is no 
mere theoretical possibility. Last September, the police called for the UK 
national database of DNA samples to be extended to include everyone. Given the 
determination of the UK government to introduce identity cards, despite 
widespread opposition and the well-known flaws in the whole approach, it can 
only be a matter of time before it links the two compulsory schemes together. 
The advantages - for the authorities - would be enormous.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Including a 
silicon chip storing your entire genome would add little to the overall cost 
once sequencing becomes cheap, but would ensure that an identity card would be 
tamper-proof and impossible to forge, since its identification number - the 
sequence of As, Cs, Gs and Ts that make up your genome - would be unique to you 
(apart from any twin) and always checkable against your DNA. Moreover, there 
would be no need for the proposed draconian legislation to make carrying such 
cards obligatory: it would be a physical impossibility to do otherwise, since 
your digital code/identification number is present in practically every cell of 
your body. This includes those you shed as skin and hair, whatever you touch and 
wherever you go - the perfect trail for government surveillance based on a 
Google-like capacity to index and cross-reference the DNA present in a given 
location at a given time.</span></p>
<p style="background: white">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">For a world of 
inveterate googlers, there would be a certain poetic justice in a future where 
we are reduced in this way to the genomic text we carry within us, and defined 
by the digital clues we strew behind us as we pass through life. After all, 
Google's immense power and undeniable usefulness as a way of finding out about 
practically anything or anyone is already bought at the price of a corresponding 
erosion of our own privacy in the online sphere - brought about by precisely 
these kinds of shifts.</span></p>

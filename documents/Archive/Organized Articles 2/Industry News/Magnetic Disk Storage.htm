<h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>
<p>The cost of magnetic disk storage space has dropped by about forty percent 
per year since 1989. Each year, the managers of more and more document 
management projects find that the cost of required magnetic disk space has 
become inconsequential in planning for their system. </p>
<h3 align="left">Magnetic Disk Storage Required for Documents</h3>
<p>Using the industry standard estimate of 50 thousand bytes of storage required 
for each scanned letter size page, and 10 thousand pages contained in each four 
drawer file cabinet, a GigaByte (about one thousand MegaBytes) is required to 
store the scanned contents of two file cabinets. Using an estimate of 50 dollars 
per GigaByte, based on current storage costs, the contents of two file cabinets 
can be stored digitally for 50 dollars. </p>
<h3 align="left">Putting the Cost of Storage in Perspective</h3>
<p>If two people discuss the cost of storage for one hour, and each person's 
time costs 25 dollars per hour, then the cost of discussing the storage equals 
the 50 dollar cost of storing the scanned images of two file cabinets full of 
documents. Because document management planning involves many people at many 
levels in an organization, and because many meetings are held at each level, the 
cost of discussion frequently exceeds the cost of the magnetic disk storage 
required to store the documents being discussed. </p>
<h3 align="left">Projecting the Cost of Magnetic Disk Storage Over the Next 20 
Years</h3>
<p>The following table shows the cost per GigaByte and the cost per TeraByte 
(about one thousand GigaBytes) in each year from 1994 through the year 2024. As 
shown in the table, one GigaByte is sufficient storage for two file cabinets of 
scanned documents and one TeraByte is sufficient storage for two thousand file 
cabinets of scanned documents. The table is generated using an assumption of a 
price reduction of 37.5 percent each year. </p>
<h3 align="left">The Basis for the Assumptions in the Table</h3>
<p>This assumption of an annual price decrease of 37.5 percent is based on an 
increase in disk storage density of 60 percent per year. With this increase, for 
a given price, one can purchase 1.6 times as much storage capacity next year as 
one can purchase this year. The corresponding annual decrease in price per unit 
of storage is therefore 37.5 percent. </p>

<p>The estimated increase is disk storage density is based on IBM's predictions 
for its magnetoresistive (MR) head technology. IBM invented the MR technology, 
and MR is currently the technological basis for advancements in the magnetic 
disk industry. IBM has been increasing the areal bit density of magnetic disks 
at a rate of 60 percent per year since 1989. IBM projects that the 60 percent 
rate of increase will continue for the foreseeable future. (Source: <cite>The 
Era of Magnetoresistive Heads</cite>, Ed Grochowski, IBM Research Division, 
Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA., 1994). </p>
<p>In a press release issued on December 29, 1997, IBM stated that the trend is 
continuing on track. As proof, IBM described a demonstration of a working disk 
configuration that could be manufactured in production quantities in the year 
2001. The demonstrated density, if applied to a 3.5 inch form factor, could 
potentially produce a 32 GigaByte, 3.5 inch magnetic disk in 2001. </p>
<p><i><b>In technospeak</b>: The latest milestone in data density was achieved 
by teams of scientists and engineers from IBM's Almaden Research Center and its 
Storage Systems Division, which develops, manufactures and sells data-storage 
products. As in IBM's previous record-density demonstrations of 1-, 3- and 
5-gigabits per square inch (announced in December 1989, March 1995 and December 
1996, respectively), manufacturable component technologies were used at 
realistic data rates, and product-level reading and writing accuracy was 
achieved. The scientists used an advanced version of the most sensitive sensor 
for reading data from disks, the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) head. </p>
<p>The areal density of 11.6 gigabits per square inch was reached at data rates 
of 14 million bytes per second. The on-track data was read essentially 
flawlessly, with an uncorrected rate of less than one error in a billion bits, 
which in products would be reduced by error- correcting codes to less than one 
in a trillion. The latter figure is equivalent to transcribing more than one 
thousand years of a daily newspaper before making a single error. </p>
<p>In addition to the advanced GMR read head, a narrow-track thin-film inductive 
write head, ultra-low-noise cobalt-alloy magnetic media and extended PRML 
(Partial-Response, Maximum Likelihood) channel electronics were used. Bits were 
packed at 315,000 per inch along the concentric tracks on the disk; tracks were 
written at a density of 36,800 per radial inch. IBM said that additional 
technical details of this demonstration would be disclosed in future scientific 
papers and conference presentations. </i></p>
<h3 align="left">A Longer Perspective for Retention Periods</h3>
<p>IBM introduced the 5 MegaByte RAMAC disk drive in June, 1957, at a monthly 
rental of $3,200.00 (in 1957 dollars). (Source: <cite>IBM's Early Computers</cite>, 
by Charles J. Bashe, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1986.) In 1957 RAMAC magnetic 
disk storage cost 100 thousand dollars per MegaByte, or 100 million dollars per 
GigaByte, to purchase. (Adjusted to current dollars, and adjusted for IBM's 
historic desire to rent rather than sell). In 1998, magnetic disk storage cost 
50 dollars per GigaByte. This represents a decline of two-million-to-one (from 
100 million dollars to 50 dollars per MegaByte) in forty-one years or about a 
29.8 percent decline per year. </p>
<p>The advances described here are based on magnetic disk technology. The study 
of the history of technology has shown that over long periods of time, as 
technologies are exhausted, new technologies replace them, and a steady rate of 
advancement is maintained. Holographic and nano-machine technologies have been 
under development for some time and promise several more orders of magnitude 
improvement in price and physical size reduction, as well as increases in speed, 
when advances in magnetic disk technology slow. </p>
<h3 align="left">Cost Adjustment for Advanced Hardware and Support Technology</h3>
<p>The cost per GigaByte for the most technically advanced magnetic disks, in 
the most advanced disk array configurations, in systems sold by vendors with the 
most extensive support, can cost up to five times as much as the cost per 
GigaByte for low tech magnetic disk drives in stand-alone generic PCs. The 
following interpretation adjusts for this difference. </p>
<p>The prices in the table change once per year. In actual practice, prices 
change continuously throughout the year. For generic systems, the listed cost 
per GigaByte is more applicable near the start of the year. For advanced 
systems, the listed cost per GigaByte is more applicable near the end of the 
year. </p>
<h3 align="left">A Scanned Page Requires 50 Thousand Bytes of Storage Space When 
Compressed</h3>
<p>All of the figures given for scanned images are for compressed file sizes. 
All imaging systems compress their image files for storage and transmission. 
Compressing removes the redundancy from the files, making the files smaller. 
These compressed page files have an average size of approximately 50 thousand 
bytes per page. Rarely is a given compressed page file exactly 50 thousand 
bytes. </p>
<h3 align="left">Five Cents per Page for Scanning</h3>
<p>Storage costs are very often less than ten percent of the cost of a document 
management system. When the cost of storage becomes inconsequential, the cost of 
scanning comes to the fore. Scanning cost can be reduced by engineering the 
production of paper out of business operations. Scanning costs can also be 
reduced by integrating scanning into the normal workflow by using digital 
copiers and by scanning documents rather than filing them. </p>
<h3 align="left">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Computer prices have a long history of substantial declines. Applications 
such as document management were at one time prohibitively expensive due to the 
cost of magnetic disk storage. Over the past few years the steady decline in 
storage prices has made document management first feasible, then an expected 
component of corporate management. </p>
<p>The cost of storage will continue to decline driven by technical advances, 
not the needs of document management. As this happens, the cost of storage will 
become inconsequential in document management planning, and other requirements, 
such as workplace reengineering, will come to the fore. </p>
<p>In addition, the continuing cost decline will bring many other document forms 
into records management. Examples are video, digital photographs, voice mail, 
and telemetry data from research, manufacturing equipment, and exploration.

<h3 align="left">Billions and Billions</h3>
<p>Transistors are so inexpensive that nobody cares much about them any more. 
But, how many can you buy for a dollar? Every bit in RAM (Random Access Memory) 
requires a transistor to hold the value of one or zero in an associated 
capacitor. There are eight bits in a byte and about a million bytes in a 
MegaByte. The cost of a MegaByte of RAM is closing in on one dollar. At a dollar 
per MegaByte for RAM, you can buy eight million transistors for a dollar. Twenty 
five years ago, RAM cost one dollar per byte, so the price reduction for RAM has 
been one-million-to-one over the past twenty-five years. As you can see from the 
table in this article, magnetic disk space will also drop by a factor of 
one-million-to-one over thirty years, so the cost of magnetic disk space is 
dropping in price at about the same rate at which RAM has dropped in price in 
the past. </p>
<p>For the nostalgia buffs, in the 1950's transistor radios were advertised 
based on the number of transistors they had. An eight transistor radio was said 
to be better than a six transistor radio. Then manufacturers started adding 
transistors for the sake of advertising rather than improving the radio, and the 
ten transistor radio was born. This eventually ran its course. But now, a 64 
MegaByte PC has over one-half billion transistors. Soon school children will 
say: &quot;My computer has a billion transistors.&quot;, &quot;My computer is better, it has 
two billion transistors.&quot;, &quot;My computer is the best, it has billions and 
billions of transistors!&quot;, &quot;. . . or is that hamburgers . . .&quot;, &quot;. . . or 
stars?&quot; </p>

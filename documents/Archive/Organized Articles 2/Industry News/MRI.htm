<p><b>NY Times</b></p>
<p>This is the radiology mantra. It is a Luddite approach to technology<br>
that vastly oversimplifies the issue. The real problem is not having an<br>
objective diagnosis and readily comparable treatment plans. Restricting<br>
physician access to technology is not a prescription for success. For<br>
example, many radiologists are now turning to interventional procedures<br>
and even some cardiology. Should they be drummed out of the profession?<br>
Why focus on imaging? What about orthopods doing unwarranted knee<br>
replacements, neurosurgeons doing spinal fusions, urologists taking out<br>
prostates? At least the imaging is causing no direct injury to the patient.<br>
<br>
The only solution I see is for technology to provide clearly objective<br>
results that leave no room for interpretation. Radiologists, if they are<br>
involved should become one with the machine and the results should<br>
completely speak for themselves. It is conceivable that the technology<br>
is already so good that radiologists are doing more harm than good by<br>
obfuscating what would otherwise be clear. For example, I believe that<br>
having humans interpret screening mammograms is already a minor<br>
disaster. The FDA has approved computer screening of PAP smears with no<br>
human ever having to look at the negatives. Mammography should be next.<br>
Then lung cancer. Then much of cardiology. Then some neuro-orthopedic<br>
problems like the ones that Butler is studying.<br>
<br>
I'll stop raving for now and try to keep this stuff mostly to myself.<br>

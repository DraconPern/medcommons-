    cardiology departments headed toward the digital age with images and patient 
    information in the last decade, following the examples of the other 
    image-intensive department — radiology — seemed like a logical step as the 
    benchmark for how to proceed with cardiology information systems (CIS).
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Radiology departments progressed to picture archiving and communica tions 
    systems (PACS) to store and archive digital images and supplemented the 
    control of workflow within the department – scheduling patients and tracking 
    films and reports within the facility – with radiology information systems (RIS).
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">What 
    cardiology departments unfortunately found in the early development of image 
    storage, archiving and transmission technology was that cardiologists and 
    caregivers were dealing with cine images with file sizes of 500 megabytes, 
    compared with radiology images in the range of 5 megabytes. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“The 
    biggest thing that is different with cardiology is that the heart is a 
    moving organ,” says Tom Feigenbaum, president of CIS vendor Problem Solving 
    Concepts Inc. (ProSolv). “You have moving images, where as in radiology, 
    most of the images – if not all – are still-frame images. There may be many 
    still-frame images, but they are not cine loops or moving images. To 
    determine function, you have to see the heart in motion and that leads to 
    larger file sizes for the captured images.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">By 
    2000, technology began to catch up with cardiology’s needs. Computers 
    advanced from 200 megahertz PCs to gigahertz PCs and computer memory (RAM) 
    increased from 128 to 512 megabytes. Standard networks grew to 10 megabytes 
    and then to 100 megabytes to offer more image and data transfer 
    capabilities. All of which converged to help handle cardiology images more 
    efficiently. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“Even 
    in the late ‘90s, people were asking the question: ‘Why can’t I just store 
    my cardiology images on my PACS with all the rest of my images?’” recalls 
    Harry Chesnut, cardiology segment manager for Agfa Healthcare. “It just 
    wasn’t do-able. Now it is both do-able and feasible.” </span></p>
    <p><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    MARKET OVERVIEW</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Cardiology is not only more dynamic and represents a distinctly different 
    patient care model than radiology. But it is newer territory for image and 
    information-based technologies. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    “Radiology has been doing this for a while, so it has had time to mature in 
    the market,” says Shawn Gibbons, product line manager of image management 
    for IDX Systems Corp.’s ImageCast division. “Cardiology has been doing it, 
    but there are more data sources to input – ECG cards, inventory systems, 
    HIS, procedural medicine systems – and traditionally they have not all been 
    aligned together with communication standards.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">In 
    its July 2003 report, market research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan noted that the 
    markets for cardiac catheterization lab and echocardiography PACS are “more 
    developed than the markets for cardiology-wide PACS solutions,” with the 
    majority of images generated in cardiology coming from cath lab and 
    echocardiography studies. Because cath labs began converting to digital 
    imaging almost 10 years ago, cath labs, the report adds, “represent a more 
    mature market than echocardiography.” Eighty to 90 percent of the cath lab 
    installed base now is digital, with some 10 to 15 percent still using film.
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Frost 
    &amp; Sullivan estimates revenues for echocardiography and cath lab PACS in the 
    United States at approximately $118 million in 2002, with projected revenues 
    of $430 million in 2009. Cath lab PACS contributed $72.3 million to the 2002 
    total, while echocardiography PACS accounted for $45.6 million. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Increasing cardiac imaging procedure volumes and proven benefits of digital 
    imaging are the two primary forces expected to drive growth over the next 
    five years. Cardiologists, the report notes, also have come to realize the 
    operational and economic benefits of digital technology and how the 
    “management of physical CD and videotape libraries is a major cost center 
    for most cardiology departments.” </span></p>
    <p><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    WHY A CIS?</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Cardiology is amongst the fastest growing (and cost-generating) departments 
    within a healthcare facility, in terms of new technology and equipment and 
    the creation of larger data sets. Thus, greater capabilities and expanded 
    features of CIS are more in demand. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“The 
    complexity of the [cardiology information] systems has grown tremendously 
    over the last couple of years and the vendors are making a push to have 
    broad cardiology systems with image management as a component and not just 
    an end piece,” says Thomas E. Kennedy, PhD, vice president of business 
    development at Camtronics Medical Systems Ltd. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">As 
    cardiologists and related caregivers require more information – such as 
    hemodynamic data, ambulatory records and text-based information – for the 
    care of a cardiovascular patient, they also are demanding a cardiology 
    information system that can deliver the data to ease today’s regulatory and 
    market pressures. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Those 
    challenges include declining reimbursement; demand within the hospital to 
    cut costs and improve efficiency; quality initiatives from the government; 
    and having to prove patient outcomes. The reimbursement issue could become 
    even more critical, Kennedy says, when payments become based on a facility’s 
    outcomes and performance. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Needless to say, one of the keys to financial viability in the new medical 
    economy is to improve efficiency. </span></p>

    Healthcare facilities, of course, have a number of issues and concerns when

    Hurley, vice president of marketing at Witt Biomedical Corp., brought a 
    hospital cardiology background with her when she joined the cardiology 
    products company. “I came from the era when we didn’t have the technology 
    that we have today. It was all hardware-driven and islands of information. I 
    can’t emphasize enough the impact of integration,” Hurley says. Providers 
    “want software and hardware that allows them to do all the clinical and 
    administrative things they need at a good price. I think that there are a 
    lot of the overused buzzwords about workflow, efficiency and productivity, 
    but people really need it now.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">For a 
    cardiologist, accessibility to complete patient images and data is at the 
    top of the CIS priority list, along with cohesive administrative functions – 
    such as scheduling and billing – to cover the business side of the practice.
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Unlike most radiologists who are employed by and work within a traditional 
    healthcare, cardiologists primarily have practices outside of a hospital and 
    are on the move between two, three or four different healthcare facilities 
    and their own main offices. That situation can create two problems: A 
    patient’s test and imaging results are scattered throughout a facility among 
    the different cardiac subspecialties, such as nuclear medicine, 
    echocardiography and electrocardiography; and, because the cardiologist is 
    not at the facility full-time, he or she may not have the influence to 
    affect a change in that process. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“I 
    see an increased frustration on the part of cardiologists, cardiology 
    administrators and cardiovascular surgeons in their ability to get the 
    information they need,” notes Bill Waters, vice president and managing 
    director of cardiology and radiology enterprises for Cerner Corp. “All the 
    subspecialties have created silos of information which [cardiac care 
    providers] find very problematic to get to. It isn’t a new story, but I 
    started hearing it five years ago and it is getting louder.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">On 
    the positive side, Waters says that more hospitals are thinking about 
    operational efficiencies within the cardiology department, as facilities 
    begin to appreciate cardiac services as a key revenue generator, despite the 
    hefty costs. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Cardiology departments these days, he adds, also are more willing to work 
    with the rest of the institution. Cardiologists “see the value of IT to help 
    them solve some of their problems and they also see the value of a broader, 
    integrated medical record,” Waters adds. </span></p>
    <p><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    INFORMATION ACCESS </span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“One 
    thing that is important in cardiology is that speed matters,” says Matt 
    Aitkenhead, Heartlab’s vice president of technical operations. “Data sets 
    that are produced by cardiac x-ray equipment with today’s generation of 1024 
    cath lab systems frequently approach a gigabyte per exam.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Cardiologists also must store a patient’s records for as long as seven 
    years, another requirement that sets cardiology requirements apart from 
    radiology departments. “Take a busy cardiac center that does 10,000 exams 
    per year and has to keep exams around for seven years,” Aitkenhead adds. 
    “That becomes quite a data management problem.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Healthcare facilities also will question whether software and upgrades will 
    integrate with their existing hardware. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“One 
    of the major concerns of each site is whether [the technology] can 
    communicate with these other systems,” says ProSolv’s Feigenbaum. </span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    That’s when DICOM capabilities of the hardware become a factor, especially 
    if and when integrating a RIS and a patient’s electronic medical record (EMR) 
    come into consideration. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The 
    bottom line is the provider’s ability to make the best patient care decision 
    based on the most information available. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Physicians “are making educated decisions that affect patient care based on 
    technology, because that is the only thing they can’t carve out of the 
    system,” says Mark Scott, Witt’s product manager. “The only way they can 
    affect change is with information to make better decisions.” </span></p>

    PRACTICAL USE </span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">St. 
    Francis Hospital in Roslyn, N.Y., is a 350-bed facility and New York's only 
    cardiac-designated hospital. St. Francis annually performs some 2,800 open 
    heart surgeries, 13,000 cardiac cath procedures and 9,000 echo procedures. 
    The facility installed Heartlab technology in 2001 and has hastened both the 
    reading and accuracy of images read. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“In 
    addition, we often can compare present studies with previous studies, which 
    is very difficult to do using videotape,” adds Alan S. Katz, MD, director of 
    medical information technology at St. Francis and consultant to Heartlab. 
    “Cardiac ultrasound is a study that can be done repeatedly. There are no 
    biohazards and often subtle changes between studies are clinically very 
    important.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">St. 
    Francis also can “view images across the enterprise,” Katz says, allowing 
    for more than one healthcare provider to simultaneously view images from 
    different locations. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“That 
    means that physicians are not hunting for a videotape that a colleague is 
    reviewing,” he notes. “Also, over the telephone, I can consult with 
    referring physicians and surgeons and improve their efficiency by discussing 
    images as we both review them.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Health First has approximately 800 beds between three hospitals in Brevard 
    County, Fla., and currently is building a new $115 million, 375,000 sq. ft. 
    heart and trauma center at its Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne. 
    The new facility – set for completion in 2006 – will add seven cath labs and 
    house all of Holmes’ cardiology services. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Health First already has 35 clinics and outpatient facilities throughout the 
    county, eight cath labs throughout its system and 15 echocardiography 
    systems. Health First handles more than 3,000 diagnostic studies per year, 
    more than 2,000 interventional procedures and more than 2,000 peripheral 
    procedures. Health First installed Heartlab CIS technology in late 2002 and 
    has 10 gigabytes available for its storage system to manage images and 
    studies from cardiology. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">One 
    prerequisite to ensuring that a CIS functions properly is involving the IT 
    department from selection of the vendor and technology through 
    implementation, says Matthew Litz, manager of Health First’s cardiac cath 
    labs. A close working relationship with the biomed department for the 
    different medical imaging modalities that a facility plans to connect to IT 
    system also is a plus. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“We 
    worked closely with the cardiology team and have recruited and hired PACS 
    administrative positions with folks who were formally in biomed and clinical 
    engineering,” adds Steve Shim, Health First’s director of technical services 
    for IT. “Now they have IT skills and have helped bridge that gap.” </span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Facilities also need to anticipate demand and cardiac service plans for the 
    short and long term when considering CIS technology today. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“Our 
    counsel to customers is, if you’re interested in buying image management 
    systems today, buy them with an eye on where you’ll evolve your 
    cardiovascular service over the next few years,” says Camtronics’ Kennedy. 
    “How are you going to expand and react to the quality initiatives that will 
    be mandated by the government? How will the image management system today 
    evolve and address those issues down the line?” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Kennedy opined that bandwidth needs will not become any greater, doubting 
    that expanding multislice CT angiography images will reach the size of a 
    high-resolution cath lab studies. </span></p>

    ROI RESULTS </span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Nebraska Heart Hospital in Lincoln, Neb., is a 63-bed facility for acute 
    cardiac, vascular and thoracic care. Nebraska opened in May 2003 with 
    Siemens Medical Solutions’ Soarian Cardiology as its base for CIS functions 
    within the new heart hospital. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“One 
    of the big advantages was that we could start from the beginning and design 
    the building and the information systems so they followed the patient and 
    clinician workflow,” says Nebraska CIO Doug Colburn. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Nebraska uses what Colburn describes as a “patient-centric care model” of 
    care, whereby a patient is admitted directly into a room and is transferred 
    from the room only to go to surgery, the cath lab or for imaging. Other than 
    those applications, other functions are brought to the patient and the 
    modular patient room can be converted to critical care, ICU, OR recovery, 
    step down or discharge. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The 
    technology already has shown benefits in the first seven months of the 
    facility’s operation. At the end of 2003, Nebraska had performed 304 open 
    heart surgeries, 358 interventional cath procedures (some of which are 
    performed by Nebraska’s affiliate, which has four cath labs), 175 vascular 
    procedures and 20 thoracic procedures. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Colburn says the hospital totaled 1,321 discharges, approximately twice as 
    many as anticipated, based on the experiences of its physicians at other 
    facilities. The doubling of the discharges was due in part to a reduced 
    length of stay to 2.5 days, compared with 4.3 days as calculated by 
    Nebraska’s physicians while working at other facilities. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Nebraska also calculated that it may take two years to reach a break-even 
    point financially, but that mark was achieved in seven months. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    “There are a lot of factors that go into that,” Colburn adds. “It’s not just 
    IT. It’s also anesthesia, it’s how we do our universal care model and the 
    team. A lot of it can be attributed to our length of stay.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">At 
    South Carolina Heart Center in Columbia, S.C., Soarian helped the facility 
    on average to add one additional cath lab procedure per day. As a result, 
    SCHC increased revenues by $720,000 in one year. Turnaround time for cath 
    lab reports also used to take 12 to 24 hours to complete. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“Now 
    with the automated capabilities, the report is completed as the physician is 
    walking out of the cath lab and the referring physicians get the report by 
    fax or email within minutes of completion of the study,” says Robert Cohen, 
    Siemens’ director of clinical departmental solutions. </span></p>

    GROUP PARTICIPATION </span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Edward Heart Hospital in Naperville, Ill., used a phased approach to convert 
    from a film to digital environment, implementing the PACS piece of 
    Camtronics’ Vericis first. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“To 
    go from a film-based to filmless environment, it probably took us six months 
    and it is still ongoing,” recalls Joe Valles, the facility’s ISS clinical 
    specialist. Plans are to connect Vericis into Edward’s HIS in the third 
    quarter and add additional features and upgrades over the course of this 
    year. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Among 
    the biggest challenge, he notes, was the integration of the PACS with the 
    hospital’s information system. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“It 
    is imperative that one understands the workflow and you have to get end- 
    users – not just the management – involved,” advises Valles. “Get the 
    physicians involved. If you can show them the features and benefits, you can 
    turn them into the biggest advocates of the system.” </span></p>

    FUTURE TRENDS </span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">CIS 
    technology is expected to become even more critical in this decade, as 
    millions of baby boomers come to an age when they require cardiac care and 
    healthcare facilities try to handle the increased demand for services.
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">With 
    the drive to incorporate as much information as possible into the CIS, the 
    natural progression healthcare providers and vendors see is the inclusion of 
    CIS information in the EMR over the next several years. Features, such as 
    report generation – which will save time and allow for more efficient uses 
    of some human resources – will help pave the way toward more facilities 
    gradually adopting EMR technology. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“That 
    time savings has to translate into better patient care,” says Witt’s Hurley. 
    “Instead of a luxury, the EMR will be the standard of care.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“It 
    is happening in other countries already,” adds Agfa’s Chesnut, “and it is 
    happening hit-and-miss around the [United States] where customers say they 
    can see the cardiology and radiology images. What [providers] also want is 
    access to the EKG or the stress system or help to synchronize that with what 
    is reported in dictation systems.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">St. 
    Francis’ Katz sees vendors being able to connect additional modalities, such 
    as nuclear medicine and cardiac MRI, to review workstations. The hospital 
    recently distributed an RFP (request for proposal) for a PACS, which can 
    bring in all the medical imaging modalities and can incorporate Heartlab’s 
    Encompass technology. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">He 
    also anticipates the development of a multimodality workstation to eliminate 
    dedicated pieces of hardware for each individual medical imaging modality.
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    ProSolv’s Feigenbaum also see the marketing trekking toward multimodality 
    capabilities, replacing the exclusivity of different workstations to view 
    echocardiology, cath lab and nuclear medicine images, and allowing 
    cardiologists and other providers the ability to view different modality 
    images side-by-side. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">“Most 
    modalities conform to the DICOM standard and that simplifies the process,” 
    Feigenbaum says. “Some, however, do not and there are different challenges 
    between each modality. However, they are fairly straightforward [with] the 
    specifications from each of the modality and hardware vendors.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Siemens’ Cohen believes the big advance will come in “bringing a tighter 
    integration between the image and information management, where it is truly 
    one piece.” </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
    Whatever the market and technology have in store, the future promises better 
    communication and integration of images with demographic and related health 
    information all for the benefit of patient care.</span></td>

<h1><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color: black">House amendment sets off 
battle for MRI business</span></h1>
<p class="byline">
<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">By Christopher 
Rowland, Globe Staff &nbsp;|&nbsp; June 11, 2004</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">House 
members have quietly approved a budget amendment that would help a politically 
connected family keep a lock on a large portion of the MRI business in the 
state, triggering a lobbying battle among doctors, hospitals, and businesses for 
a share in the state's lucrative medical imaging market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Voted into 
the proposed budget with no hearings or public debate, the measure would 
prohibit doctors from referring patients to diagnostic facilities where they own 
an interest. Proponents say they are trying to curb an unethical practice and 
close loopholes in federal antikickback laws. The concern is that doctors could 
refer patients for unnecessary tests to profit from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">But another 
immediate effect would be to freeze the number -- or even close down -- 
physician-owned MRIs in Massachusetts, opening the door for operators of 
stand-alone MRI clinics to consolidate or expand their share of one of the 
fastest-growing segments of the heath care business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">One 
potential major beneficiary of the measure would be the biggest single operator 
of MRI machines in the state, Shields Health Care Group, of Quincy, a privately 
held firm that operates 24 imaging facilities in Massachusetts. Shields operates 
more than a quarter of the machines tracked by the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The 
company's chairman and chief executive is Thomas F. Shields, who served on the 
Massachusetts Convention Center Authority and has been a frequent contributor to 
state and national political campaigns. Shields has fielded two lobbyists on 
Beacon Hill to push the MRI amendment. Groups representing the state's 
radiologists and community hospitals support the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Although 
the measure has come to be known as the &quot;Shields amendment&quot; around the State 
House, the company denied that it was behind the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">&quot;We did not 
initiate this legislation. We only responded when it came to our attention,&quot; 
said spokesman George Regan of Regan Communications Group in a prepared 
statement. &quot;The people that attribute this to us are largely entrepreneurs and 
consultants who unfortunately have misguided doctors into following a federal 
loophole to get around the antikickback statute outlawing self-referrals.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Opponents 
say the amendment would give Shields too much power in the MRI market, and they 
denounced the lack of open debate about such a far-reaching issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">&quot;We found 
out about it a day or so after it was passed by the House, which is 
troublesome,&quot; said Dr. Baltej S. Maini, chief executive of Fallon Clinic, a 
Worcester-based physicians group that is planning to add MRI services for its 
patients in Central Massachusetts. &quot;It was passed without any debate. It has 
massive implications on patient access and continuity of care, and it is totally 
under the radar.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The 
Massachusetts Medical Society, which represents doctors, is also lined up 
against the amendment. Another opponent, Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a 
major physician group in Boston, took the unusual step of mailing a letter to 
patients this week, urging them to contact top lawmakers and voice objections to 
the amendment. Partners HealthCare System Inc., which also has a physicians 
network, also is opposed.<span class="ital">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://64.4.26.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=052c73d25e4fca57b249fcbb1105b398&lat=1088374684&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eboston%2ecom%2fnews%2flocal%2farticles%2f2004%2f06%2f11%2fhouse_amendment_sets_off_battle_for_mri_business%3fpg%3d2" target="_blank" style="font-family: Tahoma; color: #000099; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">Continued...</a></span></span></p>

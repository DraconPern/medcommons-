<a href="http://www.aafp.org/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
American Academy of Family Physicians</a> has joined forces with nine vendors in 
an effort to bring high-quality, low-cost medical records technology and support 
to its members. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The move 
follows an ambitious, abandoned endeavor to develop an open-source electronic 
medical record -- based on software from
<a href="http://www.medplexus.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
MedPlexus</a> -- after other physicians groups balked at joining AAFP in the 
effort. Now, the academy said it has turned its attention to finding 
interoperable solutions for its members that, while not free and open-source, 
will still speed the uptake of technology. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;We've had 
very significant meetings with a number of companies,&quot; said David Kibbe, the 
director of the AAFP Center for Health Information Technology. &quot;They were 
telling us that it is very important for their companies ... that doctors get 
connected.&quot; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Out of those 
meetings has come an ambitious set of agreements, announced yesterday, that will 
make it easier for AAFP members to access technology. The agreements stretch 
from both smaller vendors that specialize in medical record technology to large 
IT players that are offering AAFP members an array of discounted services.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">In addition to 
MedPlexus, which will offer discounted EHR software,
<a href="http://www.a4healthsystems.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
A4 Health Systems </a>,
<a href="http://www.gemedicalsystems.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
GE Medical Systems Information Technologies</a>,

NextGen</a>, and
<a href="http://www.pmsi.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Physician Micro Systems</a> have all agreed to cut rates on their EHR 
technologies for AAFP members. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
<a href="http://www.HP.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
HP</a> said it will offer discounts on a variety of technologies through a Web 
site specifically for academy members, and Quest Diagnostics'
<a href="http://www.medplus.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
MedPlus</a> said it will offer special prices on interface software and data 
management tools.
<a href="http://www.siemens.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Siemens</a> said it will offer engineering services and managed hosting to AAFP, 
while medical instrument maker
<a href="http://www.welchallyn.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Welch Allyn</a> said it will provide IT-enabled device technology to members of 
the academy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The alliances 
are built on a four-part foundation that the AAFP has developed since abandoning 
its open-source EHR effort: affordability, compatibility, interoperability, and 
data stewardship. Doctors, Kibbe said, should have access to inexpensive 
solutions and &quot;ought not to have to scrap every other piece of IT&quot; in order to 
put in an EHR system. In addition, the academy is trying to ensure that 
different systems will be able to share data. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;The software 
may not be free,&quot; said Alan Zuckerman, an AAFP member from Georgetown 
University, &quot;but we're making progress toward open systems.&quot; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">AAFP said it 
expects the number of alliances to grow, and that it is being selective by 
ensuring that all four of its principles are met. &quot;They're all agreeing to these 
principles,&quot; said Douglas Henley, the academy's executive vice president. &quot;There 
are one or two other companies that wanted to do agreements with us, but they 
were not serious about questions of compatibility.&quot; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The vendor 
alliance marks the second major undertaking by AAFP this year in its quest 
toward easy-to-use medical records. The academy is a partner -- along with the 
Massachusetts Medical Society, Healthcare Information Management Systems 
Society, and ASTM International -- in an effort to create a so-called

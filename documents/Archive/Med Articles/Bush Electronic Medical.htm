<p><b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
BALTIMORE, Maryland (AP) -- When it comes to patients' health records, the 
United States hasn't left the &quot;buggy era,&quot; President Bush said Tuesday at a 
veterans hospital.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;On the 
research side, we're the best,&quot; Bush told about 120 guests, including veterans, 
health care professionals, doctors from Johns Hopkins Hospital and the staff 
from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Baltimore. &quot;We're coming up with 
more innovative ways to save lives. ... On the providers' side, we're kind of 
still in the buggy era.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
president has set a goal of assuring that most Americans have electronic health 
records within the next 10 years. To address issues of privacy, Bush said 
enrollment would be voluntary: &quot;Your records are private if that's the way you 
want them to be.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Noting the 
president's appearance at the VA hospital, Bush's rival, Democrat John Kerry, 
said the administration &quot;shortchanges&quot; the nation's military veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Bush's 2005 
budget calls for a new annual $250 enrollment fee and an increase in 
prescription drug copays from $7 to $15 for middle-income veterans, said the 
Kerry campaign. Kerry said the VA instituted a policy that blocked 164,000 
veterans from enrolling in the VA health care system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;George Bush 
... says he's grateful for the service of veterans, but then charges them more 
for their care,&quot; said Kerry spokesman Phil Singer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The Bush 
administration is considering closing some VA hospitals and portions of others. 
The administration also is looking at building new VA hospitals in Florida and 
other states and opening 150 outpatient clinics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">To push his 
patient records initiative, Bush is creating a national health information 
technology coordinator, a sub-Cabinet-level position, at the Health and Human 
Services Department. He said the federal government will set technical standards 
for the switch from paper to electronic medical records by the end of the year, 
so that doctors and hospitals can share patient records nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The Veterans 
Affairs Department began automating information systems in its medical 
facilities in 1985, and its hospital in Baltimore implemented a computerized 
patient record system for clinical use in 1997, White House press secretary 
Scott McClellan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Health and 
Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, who accompanied Bush to Baltimore, said 
the standards are being set so that doctors and other medical personnel 
nationwide use common terminology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;If you're 
traveling from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., or to Texas and you have an 
accident, you're going to go into the hospital, you may be knocked out, but 
what's going to be able to happen -- once we get this uniform medical records 
and this automation -- you're going to be able to go into the hospital in Texas 
and they're going to be able to download, immediately, your record.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Veterans 
Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi, who also was with Bush, said medical records 
for veterans often aren't available to health care professionals when and where 
they need them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Industrywide, 
&quot;one in every seven hospital admissions and 20 percent of lab tests occur 
because the medical information -- the health records -- are not available to 
the clinician,&quot; Principi said. &quot;More than one of every seven hospitalizations is 
complicated by medical prescription errors.&quot;</span></p>

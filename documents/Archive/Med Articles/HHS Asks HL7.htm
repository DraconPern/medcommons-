Others to Focus on EHR Core Functions </span></b><span style="color: black"><br>
</span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">by 
Brian Reid, Health-IT World </span></i><span style="color: black"><br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) has weighed in on the
<a href="http://www.hl7.org" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Health Level Seven</a> effort to create a standard model for electronic health 
records, writing HL7 to request that the group streamline the standard and focus 
on core functions of the record. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The two-page 
letter, from the co-chairs of HHS' Council on the Application of Health 
Information Technology, praised the HL7 effort and noted that &quot;substantial 
benefits to the healthcare system would ensue&quot; if the next version of the 
standard is approved by HL7 members in March. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Members of 
HL7's Electronic Health Record Special Interest Group (EHR-SIG), the working 
group charged with developing the new standard, said the HHS suggestions fit 
with discussions already ongoing. &quot;This is really not that far from work already 
taking place,&quot; said Linda Fischetti, co-chair of the EHR-SIG. &quot;This doesn't 
sound much different from what the EHR-SIG has already been working with.&quot;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The HHS letter 
focused primarily on ensuring that the standard proposed would not be 
unnecessarily complex, and it asked the group to leave concrete proposals for 
how the standard will apply to specific care settings for later consideration. 
The letter also said that &quot;future program and policy developments related to 
EHRs will take into account the work of HL7,&quot; helping further assure the 
standard-setters that the standard will be not only approved but adopted. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Though HL7's 
work on the project comes at the behest of the government -- HHS secretary Tommy 
Thompson launched the formal EHR standard push last summer -- Fischetti said 
that HL7 rules require that all stakeholders be treated equally, and that the 
proposals floated by HHS aren't automatically given priority over other 
comments. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The comments 
from HHS come as other groups give HL7 additional feedback on the standard. The
<a href="http://www.ehrcollaborative.org" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
EHR Collaborative</a>, a group of eight health technology and medical 
associations, will finish its series of four conference calls this week to help 
gather input from different medical communities. Additional reaction is expected 
over the next month. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The March 
ballot will be the second on the subject of EHRs from HL7. In September, the 
group's membership
<a href="http://www.imakenews.com/health-itworld/e_article000183628.cfm" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
shot down the first version of the standards</a>. The rejection, however, wasn't 
a surprise; members had to vote against the standards if they wanted to offer 
comments or refinements, no matter how minor. </span></p>

<p>He is coughing. He is limping. He is not doing well. Still, Donald Berwick 
manages to move briskly as he wends his way through the warren of hospitals, 
office buildings, and research labs that make up Boston's vast, ever-expanding 
medical-industrial complex. Berwick grew up professionally in this dense, 
intense Longwood Medical Area populated with residents in blue scrubs and 
technicians in white lab coats. In many ways, he is the ultimate insider, a 
Harvard-trained physician who is a professor at both Harvard Medical School and 
the Harvard School of Public Health; and the home base for his organization, the 
Institute for Healthcare Improvement, is right on Longwood Avenue. But what he 
has to say could shake the very foundation of this place.</p>

<p>Health care leaders outside of Boston -- from all over the globe, actually -- 
can't seem to get enough of Berwick lately. On this raw, rainy morning, he is 
coughing because of the nasty cold he picked up from too much air travel. In one 
five-day period in November, he was in Washington, Geneva, London, Memphis, and 
Boston, advising, among others, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, and 
the United Kingdom's National Health Service. A few weeks before that, the UK's 
secretary of state for health, John Reid, requested a private audience with 
Berwick at the British Embassy in Washington. Reid outlined the daunting task 
before him in remaking Britain's health care system and then looked across the 
long conference table to Berwick and said, &quot;Don, what should we do?&quot;</p>
<p>Berwick has been sought out by the Bush administration and Democratic 
presidential candidates Howard Dean and John Kerry for help in formulating 
health care policy. In 2002, the weekly trade publication <i>Modern Healthcare</i> 
ranked Berwick the third most powerful person in American health care, eclipsed 
only by Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson and his top 
lieutenant, Tom Scully, who runs the $435 billion Medicare and Medicaid system. 
None of the traditional luminaries in Boston medicine came anywhere near him in 
the ranking.</p>
<p>Berwick is limping because, well, his knee is shot, and he knows he will have 
to have it replaced. If he can find the time. And if he can ever get over the 
psychological hurdle of knowing just how much harm hospitals do every day. 
Berwick has spent so much time analyzing, and railing about, the dangers 
embedded in the health care system that for him to voluntarily surrender his 
knee to the knife now would be a little like Upton Sinclair bellying up to a 
diner counter to order a double cheeseburger after writing <i>The Jungle.</i> 
Berwick ticks off some of the ways a hospital might kill him: giving him an 
infection; mixing up a blood transfusion; giving him a medication he is allergic 
to; failing to prevent a pulmonary embolism; giving him respirator-associated 
pneumonia; mistakenly placing an endotracheal tube in his esophagus.</p>
<p>These are not idle worries. Every year, up to 98,000 people are believed to 
die in American hospitals because of medical mistakes. The studies that provided 
the basis for that chilling estimate were not Berwick's, yet no one has done 
more to ensure that the findings remain at the top of the national health care 
agenda. And Berwick is committed to doing more than just sounding alarms. He 
believes health care can be dramatically improved if it takes to heart the 
systems-improvement work that has transformed other industries, and if it 
focuses on eliminating the danger, waste, confusion, and arrogance that are 
pulling medicine down. He and his institute are working with several hundred 
health care organizations, large and small, in an effort to post results that 
would back up his theories. The swelling ranks of Berwick's acolytes speak of 
him in almost messianic terms. &quot;Don Berwick should win the Nobel Prize for 
Medicine,&quot; says Blair Sadler, who runs San Diego Children's Hospital. &quot;I think 
he has saved more lives than any doctor alive today.&quot;</p>
<p>But the deeper Berwick has gotten into the problem over the last decade, the 
more radicalized he has become. At this point, mild-mannered, soft-spoken, 
self-effacing 57-year-old Don Berwick can best be described as a revolutionary. 
A lot of people say the current health care system is broken, but by that they 
mean the manner of financing it. Berwick gets irritated when health care leaders 
complain about a lack of resources. There's too much money in the system 
already, he says. His critique takes aim at the medical profession's exalted 
view of itself. He's convinced that the fundamentals of the current system -- 
the same fundamentals Boston used to build its reputation as the world's medical 
leader -- are so screwed up that it is no longer possible for the medical 
profession to provide reliable, high-quality care, no matter how many 
innovations its renowned doctors roll out, no matter how many awards they rack 
up. &quot;They want to cure cancer,&quot; Berwick says. &quot;Well, how about curing health 
care?&quot;</p>
<p>His conclusion: To save the health care system, it first needs to be blown 
up.</p>

is what health care would look like if Don Berwick ruled the world, rather than 
just traveled it:</p>
<p>When you wanted to see your doctor, you would call in the morning and get an 
appointment that afternoon. And it would start on time, not an hour and three 
outdated <i>People</i> magazines later.</p>
<p>You would maintain control of your medical record, rather than needing a 
subpoena just to get a peek at it.</p>
<p>Hospitals would have genuine one-stop registration, and every employee would 
be trained to have the customer-service touch of a Ritz-Carlton concierge. No 
one would ask you to wear one of those open-backed johnnies.</p>
<p>Waiting would be kept to a minimum, because the hospital will have embraced 
flow management, anticipating rather than just reacting. There would be no 
visiting hours in the intensive care unit, since any family member could visit 
at any time.</p>
<p>Medication errors -- overdoses, allergic reactions, and other adverse 
responses -- would be all but eliminated by the universal adoption of 
computerized drug-ordering systems. Hospitals would impose a zero-tolerance 
policy for workers failing to wash their hands, a move that could save upward of 
10,000 lives a year.</p>
<p>Communication and patient-advocacy systems would put an end to horror stories 
like the one involving the 5-year-old boy who died at Children's Hospital last 
year because each of his many doctors assumed another doctor was in charge.</p>
<p>Waste would be systematically reduced. Hospital performance would become so 
transparent that finding the best place to get an operation would be almost as 
easy as shopping for a new TV online.</p>
<p>And the treatment you receive from your doctors would be made far more 
effective by a system that gave them less discretion. Physician habit and ego 
would take a back seat to science in determining standardized courses of medical 
action. Berwick argues that in terms of improving safety, health care could 
learn a lot from aviation, where commercial pilots have much less discretion 
than they used to. On a recent flight from Washington to Atlanta, he waves over 
Lisa, the bubbly Delta flight attendant, after she finishes her numbingly 
familiar safety spiel.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder how much you can deviate when you're explaining the FAA safety 
regulations to the passengers,&quot; Berwick says.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of it is dictated by the FAA,&quot; Lisa replies, before retrieving her 
manual and showing it to Berwick.</p>
<p>After she walks away, Berwick turns to me and says, &quot;The more I have studied 
it, the more I believe that less discretion for doctors would improve patient 
safety.&quot; He then looks down. &quot;Doctors will hate me for saying that.&quot;</p>
<p>Berwick distills his vision for health care into five concepts: no needless 
death, no needless pain, no helplessness, no unwanted waits, and no waste. In 
many ways, it's utopian. But he's no dreamer. He is part systems analyst, part 
proselytizer, and part scold. His nonprofit Institute for Healthcare 
Improvement, or IHI, has about 70 full-time employees, another 400 adjunct 
faculty members, and an annual budget of $27 million, with revenue coming from 
contracts with health care systems and foundation grants. Berwick is paid a base 
annual salary of $377,000.</p>
<p>More movement than consultancy, IHI runs courses, conferences, improvement 
projects, and a website and membership network designed to let health care 
institutions learn from one another. With Berwick forever on airplanes, the 
overall management of IHI rests heavily with his number two, Maureen Bisognano, 
a 50-year-old former hospital executive who brings financial discipline and a 
spirit of innovation to the organization. Still, more than a decade after its 
founding, IHI remains indivisible from Berwick, and the people who sign up for 
its services expect to get him with the package -- even if they're not always 
happy to hear what he has to say.</p>
<p>Speaking to physicians and administrators at Emory University Hospital in 
Atlanta in October, Berwick notes that teaching hospitals like theirs have the 
steepest hill to climb in fixing themselves, given their complexity, but also 
hold the biggest potential for reshaping health care, given their established 
leadership positions.</p>
<p>He also tells the crowd: &quot;When I give talks like this, I'm always reminded of 
a paper my son Dan wrote when he was in the third grade: `Socrates was a very 
smart man in ancient Greece who went around and gave people advice.' &quot; Long 
pause. &quot; `They killed him.' &quot;</p>

his bedroom, Don Berwick would hear the car start up -- usually around 2 or 3 
a.m. It was his father leaving for another house call. Philip Berwick was the 
quintessential rural doctor. If someone got sick in Moodus, a smudge on the map 
of south-central Connecticut, it was up to him to make things right. He was a 
highly respected -- and feared -- man around town. And in his own home.</p>
<p>Don was the oldest of three boys. His best friend, Richard Bernstein, who is 
now the Berlin bureau chief for <i>The New York Times,</i> explains what life 
was like for the two friends in their village of 2,000: &quot;We were Jewish in a 
non-Jewish environment. We were brainy kids who did well in school when the 
primary value was on sports. We were admired but not popular.&quot;</p>
<p>Bernstein says what set his best friend apart most was his searing 
intelligence. &quot;I've always assumed that I was a bright person. But Don always 
gave me a little bit of an inferiority complex. It was so effortless with him, 
yet he was so unassuming.&quot; During high school, Berwick and another friend 
decided to form a debate team -- just the two of them. They went on to win the 
state tournament.</p>
<p>In 1961, when Berwick was 14, his mother developed ovarian cancer. She died 
within the year. The death took an incalculable toll on the family. Bernstein 
says Berwick's mother was warm and supportive, much like her oldest son and 
quite unlike her intimidating though caring husband.</p>
<p>Berwick recalls an incident in which his father, interrupted by yet another 
patient phone call during dinner, thundered, &quot;Look, I'm the doctor. I'll decide 
when you get medicine!&quot; and then slammed down the phone receiver so hard that it 
shattered.</p>
<p>Relief for Berwick came in his undergraduate admission a few years later to 
Harvard -- a first for a Moodus native son. On his first day of freshman 
biology, a petite Rhode Island native named Ann Greenberg sat down next to him. 
They became lab partners. &quot;He was very funny, and he was really good at 
explaining things,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I decided very quickly he would be a great 
partner to have.&quot;</p>
<p>Berwick always knew he would follow his father into medicine, but he was 
determined not to return to small-town life. In his senior year, he won a 
traveling scholarship. But this was 1968, and the draft board in Moodus told him 
that unless he went directly to medical school, his only travel would be to 
Southeast Asia. So after graduating <i>summa cum laude</i> from Harvard, he went 
directly to Harvard Medical School. While earning his medical degree, he picked 
up a master's in public policy from the Kennedy School of Government.</p>
<p>Berwick did his residency in pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Boston. He 
saw miraculous medical care in action. But he also learned, intimately, how good 
people in health care, with good intentions, can sometimes unwittingly do harm.</p>
<p>&quot;I was taking care of a boy who had cancer. He was dying. I got close to 
him,&quot; Berwick recalls. &quot;One day, he got more and more distressed. I gave him an 
increase of his sedative dose. I pushed in some medicine to try to make him more 
comfortable. I did something wrong. The medicine precipitated in his IV tube. I 
didn't know what was happening. He was more and more distressed, saying, `Please 
help!' Somewhere during this period, I realized that his parents were upstairs. 
They were resting. I said to someone, `Go get his parents.' By the time they got 
to the room, he was unconscious. And I remember the mother looked at me, and she 
said, `How could you not call us?' &quot;</p>
<p>From a systems point of view, Berwick can find an answer. He was an 
overworked resident in an incredibly complex hospital trying to do his best to 
bring relief to his terminally ill patient. But from a personal point of view, 
the answer is far more elusive. &quot;I was overwhelmed with tasks, but what I did 
was irreparable,&quot; he says. &quot;You can't go back.&quot;</p>
<p>But there would be happier times. He and Ann Greenberg, his former lab 
partner, married, moved to Newton, and soon had the first of four children. He 
took a job as a pediatrician for the Harvard Community Health Plan, which at 
that point was among the nation's most creative health maintenance 
organizations. Thomas Pyle, the health plan's CEO, came to health care after 
having worked in the advertising, cosmetics, and shoe industries. He was amazed 
at how little health care knew about measuring the quality of its output. He 
created a new job -- vice president of quality-of-care measurement -- and tapped 
Berwick to fill it. That was in 1983.</p>
<p>In 1985, Pyle suggested that Berwick travel around the country to pick the 
brains of quality-improvement leaders in other industries. For six months, 
Berwick met with people at places like NASA, Gillette, Sheraton, and Bell Labs. 
He rubbed shoulders with W. Edwards Deming and Joseph Juran, the godfathers of 
the quality movement who had transformed Japan's manufacturing industry. Berwick 
was hooked and became convinced that health care could also be transformed if it 
embraced the same techniques.</p>
<p>Slight problem: Pyle had hired Berwick to be in charge of measuring quality 
so he could gauge how his system was performing. But, Pyle says, Berwick lost 
interest in measuring quality and increasingly recoiled from playing the heavy 
in assessing the performance of his fellow doctors. He wanted to focus on 
improvement rather than measurement.</p>
<p>&quot;Don and I didn't see eye to eye on this,&quot; Pyle recalls. &quot;I had some 
disappointment that he wasn't pursuing the original mission we had talked 
about.&quot;</p>
<p>For Berwick, though, there was no turning back. He started meeting regularly 
with a group of quality-improvement soul mates. In 1987, Berwick and one of 
those soul mates got a grant to run a national demonstration project, teaching 
quality improvement to 21 health care organizations in the hopes of turning them 
into Toyotas that could revolutionize health care the way the Japanese carmaker 
had scared Detroit straight. In 1989, he left his measurement job at HCHP. Other 
grants followed. He and his colleagues started running courses. Because 
organizations were paying for their services, by 1991, Berwick was still sitting 
on more than $1 million in grant money. So he used it to start the Institute for 
Healthcare Improvement; he became CEO, and his cofounder, Paul Batalden of 
Dartmouth Medical School, chaired the board. Though quality improvement had 
clearly become Berwick's passion, he assumed he would stay in this new post for 
about a year before taking a &quot;real&quot; job somewhere. Reality never set in.</p>

March of 1999, Ann Berwick completed a 28-kilometer cross-country ski race in 
Alaska. Three months later, she could barely walk. For Ann, an environmental 
lawyer almost unbounded in her love of hiking and skiing and everything outdoors 
-- she and Don had climbed Mount Rainier together -- this sudden loss of 
mobility was terrifying. Worse still was not knowing what was causing it or how 
much worse it might get.</p>
<p>Don used his many connections to get her the best care possible. Ann would 
spend about three months hospitalized in some of the nation's most respected 
health facilities, mainly Brigham and Women's Hospital as well as the Mayo 
Clinic and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Don checked out of his work at IHI 
to help manage his wife's care.</p>
<p>It became clear early on that no one would be able to tell Ann much more than 
that she was suffering from some kind of rare autoimmune spinal-cord problem. It 
also became clear that all those problems with health care Don had spent the 
last decade complaining about were even worse than he thought. &quot;I was not 
surprised,&quot; he says, &quot;but I was shocked.&quot;</p>
<p>There were medication errors. One morning, a neurologist warned that Ann 
shouldn't get a certain kind of drug. By that afternoon, someone had given it to 
her. Another medication was discontinued by her doctor on her first day of 
admission, but the nurses continued to bring it every night for the next two 
weeks. Later, her doctors decided to put her through chemotherapy to try to stop 
the deterioration of her condition. &quot;Time is of the essence,&quot; her doctor told 
her. The first dose was given 60 hours later. She was to get a single dose of 
the extremely dangerous chemotherapy drug daily for five days.</p>
<p>On the third day, the nurse came in and hung up the intravenous bag and 
started to put it in. &quot;The bag said `Number 2,' &quot; Berwick recalls. &quot;But it was 
the third dose. I was there. I had seen the others. I told the nurse. She just 
assumed I was wrong. If I had been 10 years old, she would have been patting me 
on the head, saying, `I know, I know, don't worry, honey.' I almost wanted to 
grab her by the lapels and say, `Listen! I know something!' &quot; (The nurse 
eventually checked the record, and agreed.)</p>
<p>He and Ann also saw how profound the system's amnesia is. He estimates she 
came into contact with about 100 doctors in three months. How could she get 
effective care when it was painfully clear that almost none of the doctors were 
comparing notes?</p>
<p>They also saw unbelievable waste, much of which would ultimately show up on 
their hospital bills.</p>
<p>With some notable exceptions, the people they came into contact with seemed 
to be trying their best to provide good care. It was the system that made that 
impossible.</p>
<p>Ann's condition eventually improved, and she slowly regained her ability to 
walk, though she still has considerable pain. For that turnaround, the Berwicks 
are extremely grateful. Still, the illness remains shrouded in mystery. &quot;If I 
had stayed in a lovely hotel and been waited on hand and foot for three months, 
maybe I would have gotten better faster,&quot; Ann says. &quot;It would have been more 
pleasant, <i>much</i> cheaper, more fun. I had two really major medical 
interventions. They may have saved my life or maybe were just terribly invasive 
and didn't do anything. We just don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>What Don did come away knowing was that, if this was how the best hospitals 
were capable of performing, how bad must the average care be? &quot;My wife's care 
made me angry -- angry at very, very good people,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>So here's what Don Berwick did about it. With Ann's permission, he talked 
publicly about the experience, to the more than 3,000 people who gathered that 
December for the IHI's annual National Forum.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of this move, you must first understand how 
deeply private Ann is and what an extremely gifted public speaker Don is. Even 
now, four years later, she is still uncomfortable talking about the experience. 
Even now, four years later, people are still talking about the speech.</p>
<p>Videotaped copies have even become a standard part of some medical training 
programs. Azita Hamedani first saw a copy as a Yale medical school student. She 
is now a 30-year-old chief resident in the combined emergency-medicine program 
at Brigham and Women's and Massachusetts General hospitals. In November she 
happened to be sitting next to Berwick in the back row of a Harvard lecture hall 
for a talk given by France's leading authority on medical safety. Afterward, 
Berwick turned to Hamedani and introduced himself. Outside the hall, the 
dark-haired resident still looked almost star-struck as she told me, &quot;I don't 
know the speaker. But to have Don Berwick there in the room means that I'm in 
the right place. He's a hero. This is a <i>revolution</i> in health care he's 
trying to pursue.&quot;</p>
<p>Just from appearance and demeanor, you'd expect the 5-foot-10 Berwick to 
deliver an earnest but dull PowerPoint speech. He doesn't wave his arms and 
never raises his voice, which has a low, occasionally rasping quality to it.</p>
<p>In fact, about the only way to detect his level of intensity is to look at 
his forehead. When he is most enraged, that large unlined swath of skin becomes 
grooved like a lunar landscape and his thin eyebrows just about pop off his 
head, like a comic-strip character's.</p>
<p>But there is a quiet charisma about him. He knows how to simultaneously play 
on the emotional and logical sides of his listeners' brains. He is also the king 
of metaphors. Over the years, his listeners have heard him explain health care 
in relation to his younger daughter's soccer team; the sinking of a Swedish 
warship; the Boston Red Sox; Harry Potter; NASA; the contrasting behaviors of 
eagles and weasels; his wimpy Ford Windstar (a dated reference since he now 
drives a used BMW convertible); and his left knee.</p>
<p>And he has a nice touch with levity. During that speech about surgery on his 
left knee, which he delivered last month before 4,000 people (and another 6,000 
on satellite hookup), he said: &quot;I haven't met my first grandchild yet. My wife 
and I want to take a trip to Nunavut someday. I want to hike in the Himalayas . 
. . And if you take that stuff away from me by killing me, I will be very, very 
upset with you.&quot;</p>
<p>His keynote address has become the basis by which the IHI National Forums are 
judged. In his measured way, he can be quite daring on the dais. In 2001, he 
went into character to make his point about the foolishness of doctors resisting 
his call for change. He alternately wore green and yellow cowboy hats to show 
how &quot;Dr. Olderway&quot; and &quot;Dr. Newerway&quot; would handle the same patient. Kitschy? 
You bet. But he managed to pull it off.</p>
<p>(He can occasionally be careless. That winning Socrates line he attributed to 
his son in his Atlanta speech actually comes from a sixth-grader whose work has 
been circulating on the Internet for years.)</p>
<p>But none of his speeches has had quite the staying power of his 1999 talk. He 
called it &quot;Escape Fire,&quot; because, in addition to dealing with his wife's 
hospitalization, he spoke at length about a famous wildfire in Montana in 1949 
in which one of the cornered firefighters lit a small &quot;escape fire&quot;; that blaze 
spread quickly uphill, leaving a burned patch behind. The firefighter hunkered 
down there and let the larger fire roar past him. Though his bold improvisation 
would change the practice of firefighting, on that day his response was too 
radical for any of his fellow firefighters to follow. They died, he lived.</p>
<p>Berwick told the crowd that health care needed no less a radical plan to get 
out of its current mess: &quot;We are causing harm, and we need to stop it.&quot;</p>
<p>After Berwick finishes his speech at Emory University Hospital in October, 
Dr. Jeffrey Koplan stands up to ask him a question. Koplan, the former head of 
the Centers for Disease Control and now an Emory vice president, has known 
Berwick for 30 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Don, within a few yards of your office, there's a cluster of academic 
hospitals. If one of them were to invite you over and say, `Take it over,' where 
would you start? And what would you see as the biggest obstacles?&quot;</p>
<p>Berwick smiles. &quot;My office overlooks the Brigham and the Beth Israel medical 
center, and I admire those places so much. The [National Institutes of Health] 
thinks they're great. So does the Nobel Prize Committee. They <i>are</i> great. 
But to go in and say to great places, `Let's talk defects,' it's very hard.&quot;</p>
<p>His response says a lot about why Berwick has had less traction in Boston 
than outside of it. (Berwick's collaborative model asks all hospitals to learn 
from each other. But as one Boston doctor says, &quot;Can you imagine world-class 
Mass. General being asked to follow the lead of some hospital in <i>Milwaukee</i>?&quot;)</p>
<p>But Berwick never really answered Koplan's question. Flying back to Boston 
with Berwick that October night, I press him on it: &quot;If someone offered you the 
keys to one of those respected hospitals, would you take them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd better not try,&quot; he says, smiling. &quot;It's a <i>really</i> hard job. You 
have to have many, many skills. I don't think I have them all.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, Berwick knows all too well how tough the job can be. In 1998, Dr. 
James Reinertsen, his friend and fellow soldier in the quality-improvement 
movement, took over as CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Berwick 
served as one of his references. Three years later, amid a sea of red ink and 
open hostility from the medical staff, Reinertsen was forced out.</p>
<p>No one suggests that Reinertsen's agenda for quality improvement was 
responsible for his overall ineffectiveness as leader of the newly merged 
institution, but it's a sobering lesson.</p>
<p>Today, Reinertsen stresses that the financial fundamentals have to be in 
place before you can attack quality improvement. &quot;If you're fighting for air and 
water, it's kind of hard to be doing opera,&quot; he says. Reinertsen now works for 
Berwick as a senior faculty member of the IHI, where his focus is teaching CEOs 
how to improve quality in their hospitals.</p>
<p>To date, Berwick has been much less successful in winning converts in the 
corner office than on the front lines. And even some people who consider 
themselves Berwick fans says it's a recipe for burnout for him to ask the 
self-motivated doctors, nurses, and mid-level managers who are his disciples to 
shoulder more and more of the soul-sapping improvement work without ensuring 
complete buy-in from their bosses.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes really significant commitment from the top to get the attitude of 
continuous quality improvement spread throughout an institution,&quot; says Dr. 
Troyen Brennan, president of the Brigham and Women's Physician Organization and 
author of groundbreaking studies on medical-error deaths. &quot;And it takes a <i>lot</i> 
of effort. You have to keep pounding at it. People fatigue. But it's hard for a 
CEO to identify other CEOs who have used this as their means to success, who 
have really survived and thrived as a result of it.&quot;</p>
<p>David Blumenthal, director of Massachusetts General Hospital's Institute for 
Health Policy, says that unless the reform movement tackles the 800-pound 
gorilla of health care financing, &quot;fatigue and erosion in gains&quot; will be 
inevitable.</p>
<p>Even CEOs who buy into Berwick's message will only go so far. Dr. James 
Mongan, chief executive of Partners HealthCare, the parent company of 
Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's hospitals, says any call to blow 
up the system is ultimately unworkable, because it is impossible to shut down 
the 24/7 health care system to rebuild it. &quot;Nobody, not even Don, has a whistle 
they can blow so we can stop health care and then start it again,&quot; Mongan says. 
&quot;I'm a believer that the world improves more through evolution than revolution.&quot;</p>
<p>A setback for the campaign to enlist more CEOs came last year with the 
publication of a study showing that there is currently no &quot;business model&quot; for 
quality improvement. Right now, the medical institutions that undertake 
improvement measures do not see any financial rewards, because either the 
savings show up too many years down the line or they go to another party, such 
as an insurance company. This is not a reality Berwick runs from. After all, he 
was the study's coauthor.</p>
<p>In fact, for someone who's staked his claim as a revolutionary, Berwick can 
at times be surprisingly realistic about how winnable the war might be. 
&quot;Progress is just much, much slower than I thought it would be,&quot; he says. &quot;It's 
so obvious to me. I just don't get why the leaders of health care don't see what 
I see. Sometimes I wonder, am I wrong? I'm not smarter than these people, so 
maybe [change is] not possible.&quot;</p>
<p>It's true that, for every component of his utopian vision for health care, 
Berwick can now point to at least one institution working with IHI that has 
posted stunning improvement, from Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, California, 
which has wiped out ventilator-associated pneumonia, to Dr. Gordon Moore's 
high-tech practice in Rochester, New York, which has wiped out waiting and 
inefficiency. But Berwick acknowledges that there is no system that has put it 
all together. &quot;Five thousand hospitals in this country, and not one Toyota,&quot; he 
says. While that incremental progress might have satisfied him a few years back, 
his wife's hospital experiences convinced him that revolution holds the only 
chance for sustained change. &quot;I wonder if I'm less effective for having been 
radicalized,&quot; he says. &quot;I can no longer take moderation.&quot;</p>
<p>But here's the irony. Any self-doubt he may experience comes at a time when 
Berwick is increasingly being embraced by the mainstream. The evidence is 
everywhere. When he recently addressed the board of the American Medical 
Association, for so long an old boys' collection of traditionalists, it was at 
the AMA's request -- something that would have been unheard of just a few years 
ago. Even in Boston, Berwick is beginning to get more respect from the 
traditional power centers. Mongan, who took over as CEO of Partners a year ago, 
has made quality improvement a priority and plans to spend more than $30 million 
over five years on technology designed to improve patient safety. Mongan gave 
Berwick a copy of his improvement plan in draft form and asked for his input.</p>
<p>The fact is, Berwick's proselytizing has produced so much more awareness 
about safety and quality problems in hospitals that most health care leaders no 
longer argue with his diagnosis, even if many still take issue with his 
prescription. (The areas of medicine that have adopted systems improvement, 
notably anesthesiology, have made huge leaps in safety.) Brigham's Troy Brennan 
puts it this way: &quot;The changes are small, but slowly people's attitudes are 
changing. That's something that should be very gratifying to Don.&quot;</p>
<p>And at his core, Berwick is an optimist, so the bouts of self-doubt seldom 
last long. At an IHI staff meeting in November, a staffer named Jose says he 
worries about falling behind on his projects when they all decamp for the IHI's 
annual weeklong National Forum. Berwick immediately starts furiously scribbling 
on a piece of scrap paper.</p>
<p>A minute later, Berwick jumps up. He rattles off a series of calculations he 
had just made, taking into account statistics on medical errors, the numbers of 
people who would be in the audience for the conference, and the success rates so 
far from IHI error-reduction programs. Then he offers his conclusion, which puts 
to rest any concerns Jose may have had. &quot;Every single person in this room,&quot; 
Berwick says, &quot;is going to save five lives during the forum.&quot;</p>

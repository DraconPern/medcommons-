VANCOUVER - Wireless-enabled tablet PCs can yield equivalent performance to 
high-resolution monitors for clinical image review, according to a limited study 
presented Saturday at the 21st annual meeting of the Society for Computer 
Applications in Radiology (SCAR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">&quot;(Our) 
small-scale study supports the use of tablet PCs in the viewing of 
high-resolution CR images in some clinical applications without compromise of 
diagnostic accuracy,&quot; said Dr. Wen-Jeng Lee of National Taiwan University 
Hospital (NTUH) in Taipei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">To test the 
hypothesis that tablet PCs could be deployed as mobile PACS workstations, 
researchers from NTUH compared a tablet PC (TC 1000, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, 
CA), with a PACS workstation powered by a high-resolution grayscale CRT for the 
evaluation of urolithiasis on abdominal plain film. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The tablet 
PC was equipped with a 10.4-inch, 1024 x 768-resolution color monitor, while the 
PACS workstation offered a resolution of 2048 x 2560 pixels. The researchers 
examined 80 patients who were referred to NTUH's medical imaging department for 
intravenous urography (IVU). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">CR images 
were collected before IV contrast injection for each IVU procedure. Two general 
radiologists then reviewed the images on both the tablet PC and the PACS 
workstation using the same software, blinded to the clinical information and 
results of the IVU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Each 
radiologist scored the presence of urolithiasis on a five-point scale. The 
urolithiasis was divided by the researchers into two groups: renal stones and 
ureteral stones. The study team then performed receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analysis, using IVU and clinical follow-up as the reference standard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The average 
area under the ROC curve in detecting renal stones on the tablet PC was 0.924, 
and 0.927 for the diagnostic PACS workstation. For ureteral stones, the average 
area under the ROC curve was 0.828 for the tablet PC and 0.783 for the PACS 
workstation. There were no statistically significant differences between the two 
display types, Lee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Lee said 
that the study had limitations, including its analysis only of urolithiasis on 
abdominal plain film. In addition, there was a small patient sample, which may 
have obscured interpretive differences, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The 
researchers affirmed that tablet PCs are not suitable for primary diagnosis, 
citing factors such as the longer image transfer times over the wireless 
local-area network (WLAN) as well as the CPU speed of the tablet PCs, which 
slows image manipulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">&quot;It takes 
about twice as long to (make a diagnosis on tablet PCs),&quot; Lee said.</span></p>

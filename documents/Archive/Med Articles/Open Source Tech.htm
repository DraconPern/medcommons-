<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Medicine: 
The open-source model is a good way to produce software, as the example of Linux 
shows. Could the same collaborative approach now revitalise medical research 
too?</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">CAN 
goodwill, aggregated over the internet, produce good medicine? The current 
approach to drug discovery works up to a point, but it is far from perfect. It 
is costly to develop medicines and get regulatory approval. The patent system 
can foreclose new uses or enhancements by outside researchers. And there has to 
be a consumer willing (or able) to pay for the resulting drugs, in order to 
justify the cost of drug development. Pharmaceutical companies have little 
incentive to develop treatments for diseases that particularly afflict the poor, 
for example, since the people who need such treatments most may not be able to 
afford them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">It is in 
this environment that a number of medical biologists, lawyers, entrepreneurs and 
health-care activists have sought improvements. They have suggested borrowing 
the “open-source” approach that has proven so successful in another area of 
technology, namely software development. This is a decentralised form of 
production in which the underlying programming instructions, or “source code”, 
for a given piece of software are made freely available. Anyone can look at it, 
modify it, or improve it, provided they agree to share their modifications under 
the same terms. Volunteers collaborating in this way over the internet have 
produced some impressive software: the best-known example is the Linux operating 
system. So why not apply the open-source model to drug development too?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">In fact, 
open-source approaches have emerged in biotechnology already. The international 
effort to sequence the human genome, for instance, resembled an open-source 
initiative. It placed all the resulting data into the public domain rather than 
allow any participant to patent any of the results. Open source is also 
flourishing in bioinformatics, the field in which biology meets information 
technology. This involves performing biological research using supercomputers 
rather than test-tubes. Within the bioinformatics community, software code and 
databases are often swapped on “you share, I share” terms, for the greater good 
of all. Evidently the open-source approach works in biological-research tools 
and pre-competitive platform technologies. The question now is whether it will 
work further downstream, closer to the patient, where the development costs are 
greater and the potential benefits more direct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
Open-source research could indeed, it seems, open up two areas in particular. 
The first is that of non-patentable compounds and drugs whose patents have 
expired. These receive very little attention from researchers, because there 
would be no way to protect (and so profit from) any discovery that was made 
about their effectiveness. To give an oft-quoted example, if aspirin cured 
cancer, no company would bother to do the trials to prove it, or go through the 
rigmarole of regulatory approval, since it could not patent the discovery. (In 
fact, it might be possible to apply for a process patent that covers a new 
method of treatment, but the broader point still stands.) Lots of potentially 
useful drugs could be sitting under researchers' noses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The 
second area where open source might be able to help would be in developing 
treatments for diseases that afflict small numbers of people, such as 
Parkinson's disease, or are found mainly in poor countries, such as malaria. In 
such cases, there simply is not a large enough market of paying customers to 
justify the enormous expense of developing a new drug. America's Orphan Drug 
Act, which provides financial incentives to develop drugs for small numbers of 
patients, is one approach. But there is still plenty of room for 
improvement—which is where the open-source approach might have a valuable role 
to play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">In a 
paper presented this week in San Francisco at BIO 2004, the Biotechnology 
Industry Organisation's annual conference, Stephen Maurer, Arti Rai and Andrej 
Sali—two lawyers and a computational biologist, respectively—called for an 
open-source approach to invent drugs to fight tropical diseases. It would work 
like this: a website they call the Tropical Disease Initiative would allow 
biologists and chemists to volunteer their expertise on certain areas of a 
specific disease. They would examine and annotate shared databases, and perform 
experiments. The results would be fully transparent and discussed in chat rooms. 
The authors expect that the research, at least initially, would be mainly 
computational, not carried out in “wet” laboratories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The 
difference between this proposal and earlier open-source approaches in 
biomedical research is that where before scientists swapped software, here they 
would collaborate on the data. And where projects such as the mapping of the 
human genome relied on massive top-down government involvement, this proposal 
would, like an open-source software project, be the result of bottom-up self-organisation 
among researchers themselves. That said, the authors acknowledge that a 
government or grant-giving charity would probably have to provide the initial 
funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Moreover, 
the results of the research would not be made available under an open-source 
licence of the kind that governs software projects. Instead, the final 
development of drug candidates would be awarded to a laboratory based on 
competitive bids. The drug itself would go in the public domain, for generic 
manufacturers to produce. This, the authors state, would achieve the goal of 
getting new medicines to those who need them, at the lowest possible price. “We 
are so used to patents that we forgot ways to discover drugs in the public 
domain, and we need to rediscover them,” says Mr Maurer, of the Goldman School 
of Public Policy at the University of California in Berkeley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">This is 
just one of many attempts to extend elements of the open-source 
software-development model to drug research. Yochai Benkler, a law professor at 
Yale, imagines test-tube and animal studies organised in this manner, exploiting 
the “excess capacity” of graduate students and university labs, much as students 
and academics also contribute to open-source software development.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: #000099">Trial and 
error</span></b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Eric von 
Hippel, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School 
of Management, is investigating how secondary uses for drugs are discovered, 
with a view to harnessing doctors and patients to record data. Many medications 
are approved for one purpose, but are regularly prescribed for another, 
“off-label” use. In many instances, new uses for a drug are discovered only 
after it is on the market, when a sort of natural experimentation takes place. 
For instance, Botox was approved in America for treating eye-muscle disorders, 
and only later found to remove wrinkles. In Europe and America, as many as half 
of all drug prescriptions for certain diseases fall into this category. The 
drugs often do not go through the formal process for other uses because the cost 
of regulatory approval is so high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">This is a 
problem for a number of reasons. First, it means that drug companies are 
prohibited from advertising the medications based on these additional uses, so 
some patients may not get the treatment that would benefit them. Next, insurance 
companies in America usually only cover on-label use. And the effectiveness of 
the treatment is not formally evaluated. Dr von Hippel's idea is to decentralise 
the process of obtaining data on the off-label use, by collaborating with 
volunteer doctors and patients. By defraying costs in this way, it might then be 
possible to obtain regulatory approval. It is, in effect, an open-source 
clinical trial. Because the drug has already been approved, it has passed 
first-phase tests for safety. These do not have to be repeated. Second and 
third-phase drug-approvals test for efficacy and side-effects—and these are the 
very areas where getting formal approval for off-label use is sensible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
Meanwhile, not far from Dr von Hippel at MIT, thousands of fruit flies are being 
decapitated. Peter Lansbury, the head of a research lab at Harvard Medical 
School, avows that they are treated with chloroform, so “they don't feel a 
thing”. The fruit flies have Parkinson's disease, and Dr Lansbury's research is 
examining the therapeutic effect of a thousand approved drugs, on which the 
patent has expired in most cases. Might one of them turn out to be an effective 
treatment?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">This sort 
of research is unusual because there is no working hypothesis to prove and no 
way to profit if the project is successful. It has simply never been studied 
before, and should be, says Dr Lansbury, who is the co-founder of the Laboratory 
for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration. The laboratory has around 25 
researchers and an annual budget of $2.5m to work on neurodegenerative diseases, 
such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, to which the major commercial drug 
companies devote few resources because their potential market is small.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Dr 
Lansbury refers to the work as “not-for-profit drug discovery”, but he sees 
direct parallels with the open-source approach. For one thing, his group places 
much of its data in the public domain. Secondly, though the research is mainly 
happening among different research labs within the confines of Harvard at the 
moment, the goal is to involve other scientists around the world. Only through 
this sort of collaborative, distributed approach will treatments be found for 
these diseases, he says. As for the intellectual property that may be created, 
the goal is to use patents only to license treatments cheaply to pharmaceutical 
companies to ensure a supply of drugs at low cost. But the most important thing 
is to discover the drugs in the first place—something commercial 
drug-development seems unable to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">There are 
a number of other similarities between biomedical research and open-source 
software development. First, both fields attract the same sort of people. 
Biology, like software, relies on teams of volunteers, notably graduate students 
and young professionals, who have an incentive to get involved because it will 
enhance their professional reputations or establish expertise. Both medical 
biologists and computer scientists aim to improve people's lives and make the 
world a better place. And as the human-genome project showed, both cultures 
respond strongly to grand projects, not just financial incentives—possibly 
because they are generally highly paid to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">That 
said, the dissimilarities are profound. The financial needs and time to complete 
projects are wildly different. A new piece of software can be thrown together in 
days or weeks, and rarely more than a few months. The barriers to entry are low: 
many pieces of software begin life in an enthusiast's bedroom or garage. 
Pharmaceutical research, in contrast, is measured in years, fails more often 
than it succeeds, and requires hard-core credentials and in many cases expensive 
equipment, not just hard work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Moreover, 
the computational portion of the drug-discovery process—typified as upstream, 
far from the patient, at the early-stage level, where profits are thinner—is not 
the costly bit. Rather, it is the less computer-intensive things such as toiling 
in wet laboratories, performing clinical trials and navigating the 
regulatory-approval process where one finds the bulk of the cost of bringing a 
drug to market. The closer to the patient one goes, the tougher it is to imagine 
open-source processes making a significant impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The 
application of the open-source approach to drug development may prove to be more 
useful as an analogy than an application, notes Janet Hope, a lawyer completing 
a doctorate on “open-source biotechnology” at the Australian National 
University, in Canberra. One reason is that different intellectual property 
rights apply, and are protected differently. Software usually falls under 
copyright, which arises automatically and without cost to the author. Biomedical 
discoveries are generally protected by an entirely different legal regime, 
patents, which are costly to obtain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">This 
helps explain why the drug-discovery and development projects place their work 
in the public domain, rather than trying to enforce some form of reciprocal 
openness through an open-source licensing agreement, as software does. Those 
involved in the human-genome project investigated the possibility in 2000 of 
applying an open-source licensing agreement to the results, but decided that 
simply throwing the results into the public domain—without any restriction on 
their use—was better. Its successor project, the International HapMap Project, 
which is mapping the common patterns of variation within the genome, imposes an 
open-source licence for research in progress. But it places the completed data 
in the public domain and allows patents on subsequent discoveries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">This 
suggests that continued reciprocal sharing, a key part of open-source software 
development, may not have a meaningful equivalent on the biological side of the 
fence. With open-source drug discovery in the public domain, where there is no 
legal obligation to share one's inventions, there is no guarantee that 
philanthropic sentiments will override self-interest. Participants can always 
choose to send their results to the patent office rather than the communal web 
site. While the open-source approach shows much promise in drug discovery, it is 
certainly no panacea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">More 
broadly, two big questions remain unanswered as the open-source approach starts 
to colonise disciplines beyond its home ground of software development. The 
first is whether open-source methods can genuinely foster innovation. In 
software, all that has been developed are functional equivalents of proprietary 
software—operating systems, databases, and so on—that are sometimes slightly 
better and sometimes glaringly worse than their proprietary counterparts. Their 
main distinction, from users' point of view, is simply that they are available 
free of charge. Curiously, this matches the complaint levelled against 
pharmaceutical companies for developing “me-too” drugs to compete with other 
firms' most successful product lines—witness the current crop of Viagra 
imitators—rather than spending their research money in an entirely new area.</span></p>

second question is semantic. What does it mean to apply the term “open source” 
in fields outside software development, which do not use “source code” as a term 
of art? Depending on the field in question, the analogy with source code may not 
always be appropriate. It seems the time has come to devise a new, broader term 
than “open source”, to refer to distributed, internet-based collaboration. Mr 
Benkler calls it non-proprietary peer-production of information-embedding goods. 
Surely someone, somewhere can propose something snappier.</span></p>

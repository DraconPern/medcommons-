This article, written by yours truly, appears in the January Newsletter of the
<a href="http://www.houstonpsychiatry.org" style="color: #006666; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Houston Psychiatric Society</a>: <i>Over 20 years of proprietary medical 
computing has brought medicine software which is very expensive, incompatible 
and frequently not very useful. Practically every health care entity has had the 
experience of an expensive medical record software disaster. Physicians and 
Health Information Technology professionals appear to be simultaneously 
recognizing the crucial role that medical software should be playing in 
healthcare while finding that proprietary software in medicine is simply not 
working. Fortunately, the ground rules appear to be changing. There is increased 
recognition that software freedom's are essential for achieving good, 
affordable, interoperable clinical computing software.</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #333333">The rights to study, modify 
and extend medical software are essential in changing the bleak picture in 
clinical computing. While it is likely that few clinicians will exercise these 
freedoms, they are important to retain in the event they are needed. These are 
not abstract rights. A common occurrence is one in which medical software 
companies go out of business or are bought out. These events can put 
practitioners in serious trouble. </span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #333333">In the current software 
world, the clinician is denied the fundamental freedom to fix, modify and extend 
medical software they have paid for and may be stranded with dead software. Or 
worse, may be forced by corporate agendas to abandon software that works. 
Clinicians may be specifically prevented from hiring outside service companies 
or fixing problems themselves because of this. This should be un-thinkable in 
medicine but is in fact how much of proprietary clinical software functions 
today through restrictive licensing. Related issues such as software 
incompatibilities, re-inventing clinical computing software multiple times are 
other consequences of not having these fundamental freedoms. Others are not 
being able to effectively train personnel on non-standard systems and being at 
the mercy of a software company when it is time to upgrade. History has shown 
that all of these consequences are exceedingly expensive. </span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #333333">It does not have to be this 
way. Non-proprietary software which is often known as Free or Open Source 
software is swiftly coming into being in medicine. The key is in licensing that 
guarantees software freedoms. Chief Information Officer of UCLA medical center 
Mike McCoy, MD sees it happening first hand. McCoy is in charge of $60 million 
in annual health information technology expenditures and is 'humbled' by the 
quality and interoperability of Free and Open Source software in medicine. He 
says that it isn't just about price and strongly advocates its use. The 
Department of Defense as well as large companies such as IBM also advocate and 
use this kind of software. </span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #333333">Incidentally, 'Free' refers 
to guaranteed freedoms, not price. While the software is freely obtainable, 
service, training and documentation by others can (but do not have to be) 
paid-for items. The expense of software engineering is spread out across 
organizations. Therefore, current medical software and service companies can 
benefit from this type of software as well and need not go out of business.
</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #333333">There are now several 
mature or maturing non-proprietary medical software packages such as the 
psychiatry-oriented SQLclinic http://www.sqlclinic.net and TORCH http://www.openparadigms.org. 
They are covered by licenses which guarantee software freedoms instead of taking 
them away. In the case of the Veterans Administration VistA software, http://www.medsphere.com 
or http://www.hardhats.org you may have already paid for it with your tax 
dollars. VistA is used daily and is overwhelmingly liked by physicians and 
nurses. </span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="color: #333333">Clinical computing software 
has been attempted since at least the 1970's, yet there currently exists little 
in the way of standardized, inexpensive and useful clinical software. By some 
estimates, medicine has spent billions over the last decades on medical 
computing, yet has little to show for its expenditure. This appears to be 
changing as Free and Open Source medical software becomes mainstream. It only 
requires advocacy, clinical use of Free software and the insistence on retaining 
the rights to study, modify and extend medical software with vendors. These 
freedoms are essential and can lead medicine out of many of its current 
problems. </span></i></p>

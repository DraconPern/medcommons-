the computer age began, some people warned that the rise of word-processing 
systems would mean the decline of skillful writing. The idea was that computers 
would make writing so automatic and easy - yeah, sure -that fine points of 
thought and language would be buffed away, leaving depersonalized, machinelike 
prose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">In 
retrospect, there was nothing to worry about. Books, articles and lectures are 
now as good, and bad, as they have ever been. One area that technology has 
obviously changed is personal communication, through e-mail and instant 
messaging. But there, its main effect has been positive, in reviving what had 
been the moribund idea that people, even teenagers, could stay in touch through 
written as well as spoken words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The broader 
ways in which computers will change our modes of thought and interaction are 
hard to predict, so any early indicator is interesting. Electronic calculators, 
for instance, have already eliminated one ingredient from the traditional 
concept of being &quot;smart.&quot; From the invention of arithmetic until about 1970, 
speed and accuracy in handling numbers were a mark of intellectual distinction. 
Now computational skill is a parlor trick because the most gifted human prodigy 
cannot keep up with the cheapest hand-held device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">A &quot;sticky&quot; 
mind, one that retains names and ideas and retrieves them on demand, has 
traditionally been a proxy for one kind of intelligence. But how long will that 
matter, as search engines grow faster and more precise? We'll know the change 
has come when a schoolchild with Google can knock off any &quot;Jeopardy&quot; champ.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">Long before 
that happens, another change driven by Google could have a cultural, and perhaps 
even political, impact. This is the place to note, however, that Google is not 
necessarily synonymous with &quot;the future of search technology.&quot; Bill Gates of
<a href="javascript:Filtered()" target="_blank" style="font-family: Tahoma; color: #000099; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">
Microsoft</a> has given more and more pointed warnings that his company is 
preparing a frontal challenge for dominance in computerized searches. No one in 
the technology world doubts that Microsoft has the talent, the money and the 
power to pose a formidable threat to Google. Even now, in some circumstances, 
small, specialized search tools can improve on Google's results. My recent 
favorite is Vivísimo, founded by scientists at Carnegie Mellon University, which 
clusters search results into useful categories rather than putting them in one 
big list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">But Google 
is the clear leader, among competitors like Overture and Kanoodle, in a 
modest-seeming innovation with potentially broad implications. For Google, it is 
another way to sell ads - and a fast-growing source of revenue. For people who 
rely on the Internet for information and expression, it may open an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">The 
innovation in question is Google's AdSense program, unveiled last summer. 
Google's original way of making money, and still its largest source of revenue, 
was search-driven ads. You enter, say, &quot;vacation homes in France,&quot; and with its 
usual list of sites Google shows a list of &quot;sponsored links&quot; from advertisers, 
who have paid to be associated with those terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">&quot;AdSense 
was really a very natural outgrowth&quot; of this search-dependent system, said Gary 
Stein, a senior analyst at Jupiter Media in San Francisco. (No one from Google 
would comment about its products because the company is in the &quot;quiet period'' 
before its initial public offering.) &quot;Google had this great database of 
advertisers, and the keywords they were interested in,&quot; he said. &quot;But they had 
to wait for the searches to happen.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Tahoma; color: black">AdSense 
allows Google and the advertisers to avoid the waiting. Google's great technical 
strength - the &quot;sun in its solar system,&quot; as Mr. Stein put it - is the way it 
automatically grasps the themes and emphases of each Web page. With AdSense, 
anyone who operates a Web site - a blogger, a community activist, a retailer - 
installs a bit of code that transfers control of part of each page to Google. 
Then users who visit the page will see a short list of ads that, according to 
Google's analysis, represent the most likely match between the subjects 
discussed there and the advertisers' products - ads for veterinary supplies on a 
cat fanciers' site, for example. Each time someone clicks on an advertiser's 
link, the advertiser pays a fee to Google, and Google passes some of that on to 
the Web site operator.</span></p>

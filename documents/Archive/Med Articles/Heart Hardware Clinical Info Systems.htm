Eclipsys scores two new clients, while GE and Guidant agree to work together 
toward a pacemaker that can talk to a clinical information system. Other 
pairings in this week's alliance-heavy roundup: IBM and UCSF, and Kodak buys 
Algotec. Corporate marriage announcements always welcome at

  GE Medical Systems</a> said it has allied with heart device powerhouse
  <a href="http://www.guidant.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
  Guidant Corp.</a> to develop tools that would allow Guidant implantable 
  cardiovascular devices, such as pacemakers, to communicate with clinical 
  information systems. The companies said their goal is to develop an open 
  standard that would allow for medical device data to be automatically 
  integrated into a patient's medical record. The effort builds on Guidant's 
  existing Advanced Patient Management push, which seeks to incorporate 
  additional information technology into its pacemakers, defibrillators, and 
  cardiac resynchronization devices. </span></li>

  <a href="http://www.eclipsys.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
  Eclipsys'</a> Sunrise XA clinical information system, the company said this 
  week. Georgia's 315-bed Athens Regional Medical Center and San Antonio's 
  University Health System, which includes a 478-bed hospital and a number of 
  community clinics and offices, will both use the company's software, including 
  the Sunrise computerized patient record. Eclipsys said it will also install 
  its medication management and clinical documentation modules, while University 
  Health will utilize Eclipsys' critical-care and ambulatory tools. The deals 
  mark the biggest week of announcements for the clinical IT bellwether since 
  the company announced problems with the SunriseXA workflow engine last month. 
  Despite the company signing more deals, investors have pummeled the stock, 
  which has dropped from $18.29 on Sept. 23 to $9.46 at the close yesterday.

  IBM</a> and the University of California at San Francisco, said they will work 
  together to make the reams of genetic information flowing from researchers 
  more useful in the clinic. The school said the collaboration, which will 
  initially focus on neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, will give 
  researchers a simple, Web-based interface with which they can mine data from 
  across the institution, from clinical encounters to DNA chip results. To build 
  the system, IBM experts will work on site with UCSF researchers, the school 
  said. </span></li>

  Algotec Systems</a> for $42.5 million. Privately-held Algotec is a developer

  use its new purchase as a &quot;center of excellence&quot; in creating PACS innovations.

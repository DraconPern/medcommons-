<p>The river of revenue flowing out of physician practices into the coffers of 
diagnostic imaging centers is prompting some groups to try to build a dam by 
taking matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>Physician groups, feeling the pinch of declining reimbursements, are 
increasingly opening their own diagnostic imaging centers so they can hold on to 
revenue that previously left the practice with patients sent elsewhere for 
expensive scans and studies.</p>

</table>
<p>&quot;It's just addressing the issues of the business of medicine, trying to make 
ends meet. [Opening our own imaging center] offers us an opportunity to capture 
that revenue that we were sending somewhere else,&quot; said Joseph Cincotta, MD, 
whose multispecialty group in Lemoyne, Pa., opened an imaging center nearly 
seven years ago.</p>
<p>Experts say many of these ventures are profitable, though they are not 
without risk.</p>
<p>The financial commitment necessary to launch a diagnostic imaging center and 
maintain its equipment can be daunting: into the millions of dollars. 
Additionally, the legal implications of physicians owning such facilities must 
be carefully considered to stay clear of laws prohibiting self-referral. And 
recent reports from the Center for Studying Health System Change and the 
BlueCross BlueShield Assn. have suggested that insurers are questioning the high 
costs of imaging services and increasingly taking steps to restrict coverage of 
them.</p>
<p>But more and more physicians appear to be willing to take on the risks in 
hopes of benefiting from added revenue as well as from increased access and 
convenience for themselves and their patients. And with demand for diagnostic 
imaging services increasing as technology advances, it appears unlikely that the 
trend will slow any time soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Imaging is proliferating, and forecasts are that it is expected to 
continue,&quot; said Douglas Smith, a partner with Barrington Lakes (Ill.) Group 
Inc., a radiology consulting and management firm. &quot;Clearly, over the past five 
years there has been a steady increase of the utilization of imaging services in 
the hospital setting, outpatient setting and in the physician office.&quot;</p>
<h3>Not just for radiologists</h3>
<p>Though the number of diagnostic imaging centers opened each year is not 
available, numbers certainly show that imaging itself is a busier field. The 
American College of Radiology estimates that between 1998 and 2001, procedures 
involving MRIs grew about 16% while use of CTs, sonography, nuclear medicine and 
interventional radiology grew between 7% and 15%.</p>
<p>And looking at just one type of service in the burgeoning field of cardiac 
imaging, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology estimates that about 5 
million cardiac nuclear imaging procedures are now performed annually, up from 
about 3 million five years ago.</p>
<p>Although imaging is traditionally the arena of radiologists, physicians of 
all specialties are now opening their own imaging centers. Some might offer 
multiple services, while others feature only x-rays. For Dr. Cincotta and his 
colleagues in Heritage Medical Group, opening a multimodality imaging center 
made sense when the group came together in 1998 to form a 52-physician 
multispecialty practice.</p>
<p>&quot;As part of that startup, one of the underlying principles was asking 
ourselves: What can we do together that we can't do alone? And how can we 
capture some of the revenue that we generate that is going other places?&quot; Dr. 
Cincotta said.</p>
<p>Startup costs were significant, with the price of the equipment and facility 
build out alone roughly $1.7 million. The group also paid a consultant to help 
create a business plan and structure the ownership of the center, and paid to 
lease space for the center.</p>
<p>Housed in a building with other medical services, the center offers x-rays, 
mammography, fluoroscopy, bone density scans, ultrasound, CT scans and MRI 
services. The group contracts with a radiology group to read the studies.</p>
<p>Without MRI, the center was bringing in about $2.5 million in gross revenue 
and $500,000 in profit annually. Group executives planned to spend about $1 
million adding MRI services, and expected profits to jump accordingly.</p>
<p>Dr. Cincotta said if he had to do it over again, he might tweak what services 
are offered. For example, he said fluoroscopy has proven to be highly labor 
intensive and low on profit margin. But overall, he said, it has been a positive 
business venture for the group, it has served patients as a convenience and it 
has helped physicians in the group have more control over scheduling.</p>
<p>Other physicians choose to share the financial risks of opening an imaging 
center with another entity such as a hospital, an imaging development company or 
another physician group.</p>
<p>Historically, Smith said, these joint ventures involved partnerships between 
hospitals and radiologists, who got involved because they were considered 
nonreferring physicians, so it was easier for them to allay legal concerns about 
self-referrals.</p>
<p>But in the last few years, Smith said, the business has broadened to include 
more competition from other physicians and business groups.</p>
<p>&quot;In some sectors you'll see that it's competitive as can be. Where the 
hospital and radiologists haven't figured it out yet, somebody will,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Market demand will be met.&quot;</p>
<p>Three-way joint ventures, involving a hospital, radiology group and a 
specialty physician group such as cardiologists or orthopedists, are now 
surfacing as well. &quot;Typically they've used each other as competitors. Now they 
are viewing each other as collaborators and partners,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>Ken Davis, a health care attorney with Katten, Muchin, Zavis &amp; Rosenman in 
Chicago, said he had seen a new model of joint ventures recently involving 
medical practices that share the same office building. He has seen those groups 
come together to build a center in their shared space.</p>
<p>&quot;Under this model, no single group practice has to be financially at risk for 
an entire magnet [or other equipment]. Instead, they are only financially at 
risk for their anticipated piece of the capacity of that imaging center,&quot; Davis 
said.</p>
<p>For all the different models, Davis said, a key to success is ensuring that 
there will be enough patient volume to warrant making such a significant capital 
investment.</p>
<p>The financial risks are great. Groups might have to tie their financial 
success to the success of the imaging center. And physicians in a group might 
have to give personal guarantees on loans used to finance the project, meaning 
their personal wealth would be jeopardized if the center fails.</p>
<p>&quot;And there are plenty of these ventures that fail; it's not a dead bank 
certainty,&quot; Davis said.</p>
<p>There is also some legal concern with physician development of imaging 
centers because of the federal Stark law, which prohibits physicians from 
referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities in which they have a 
financial interest.</p>
<p>But Davis said Stark has an exception that allows referring physicians to 
open imaging centers under certain conditions. The so-called in-office ancillary 
services exception allows physicians in a group practice to refer to the 
practice for ancillary services such as imaging. The exception is only available 
for group practices, so physicians who can't meet that criterion could run afoul 
of Stark.</p>
<p>Davis said other laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and state 
certificate-of-need laws, also should be weighed by physicians who are planning 
a diagnostic imaging center. But with a well-structured business plan and the 
proper legal advice, he said, the centers often can be launched in a legally 
sound way.</p>
<p>The capital required to start a diagnostic imaging center is substantial. A 
small operation could cost $500,000 to $1 million to build and equip while a 
large one could cost $5 million to $8 million, said Robert Maier, president and 
CEO of Regents Health Resources, a Brentwood, Tenn.-based firm that does 
consulting and development work in medical imaging.</p>
<p>Fueling the high capital costs are the equipment itself, the shields that 
must be built into the facility to protect against the powerful equipment, and 
the need for upgrades and new equipment purchases as technology advances.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of capital required both to start and maintain this business. 
So that has to be well thought out in the beginning,&quot; Maier said. &quot;It's not a 
matter of turning on the cash spigot and suddenly the money is there.&quot;</p>
<h3>Check contracts, competition</h3>
<p>Maier recommends that physicians research their potential contracts with 
payers before starting a diagnostic imaging center. He said more and more payers 
are &quot;looking askance&quot; at this type of development because they are concerned 
about the potential for abuse by referring physicians.</p>
<p>Other experts warn that starting a diagnostic imaging center could chill a 
physician group's relationship with a local hospital by creating competition 
between the two.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that as these ancillary services grow in terms of a trend, 
the economic pressures on the hospital become greater,&quot; said Steven Williams, 
senior vice president of marketing and sales for Irving, Texas-based 
MedSynergies, which provides financial and IT consulting services to physicians. 
&quot;The economic balance fails here, and hospitals are therefore incentivized to 
try to capture or recapture the revenue they have lost.&quot;</p>
<p>And finally, experts say launching a new venture will require some patience, 
with profits likely not surfacing until after the first year.</p>
<p>John A. Tata, MD, a radiologist and consultant in Queensbury, N.Y., who has 
helped develop three imaging centers, said his group learned to be patient when 
it opened a center in a new market.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though we had some working relationships with some physicians in that 
community, for the most part we were a relatively new commodity, so we really 
had to prove ourselves,&quot; Dr. Tata said.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes a while to grow and mature.&quot;</p>

Integrates Drug Research, Healthcare </span></b><span style="color: black"><br>

<a href="http://www.ibm.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
IBM</a> has started a new business unit focused on medicine within its life 
science division, promising to help customers integrate healthcare data, 
including research, genetic tests, patient medical records, clinical trials 
records, and medical images. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Operating as 
of Monday, the global unit is headed by vice president Mike Svinte, but IBM has 
not yet determined how many people will work in the unit. Svinte declined to 
reveal how much money IBM is investing in the &quot;information-based medicine&quot; unit 
but claimed it was &quot;significant.&quot; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">IBM has coined 
the phrase &quot;information-based medicine&quot; to describe its approach to integrating, 
mining, analyzing, and managing medical data from a variety of sources. The 
objective is to pull together information to provide researchers and doctors 
with better access to data with the goal of better patient care and drug 
development. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The unit will 
work with IBM partners that, for instance, offer life science applications for 
use with IBM software, including its middleware. Svinte offered as a partnership 
example IBM's work with
<a href="http://www.decode.com" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
deCODE Genetics</a>, which has amassed enormous amounts of genetic, 
genealogical, and medical information on people in Iceland, where it is located. 
The two have paired to offer tools for analysis and data mining. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&quot;What we see 
happening is the convergence between life sciences, healthcare, and IT,&quot; Svinte 
said. &quot;The thought is that convergence really has the ability to change the way 
healthcare is delivered, to change the diagnosis and treatment.&quot; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Although IBM 
is already involved in projects that will be under the auspices of the 
information-based medicine unit, existing customers will find the start of that 
unit &quot;transparent,&quot; Svinte said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The field of 
information-based medicine is so new that a successful business model has not 
yet been clearly defined, and that could be a challenge IBM faces as it attempts 
to take a lead role, said Eric Brown, a vice president at Forrester Research in 
Cambridge, Mass. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The key 
question is who will pay for such data-integration systems. &quot;What's the business 
model for these going forward?&quot; Brown asked. </span></p>

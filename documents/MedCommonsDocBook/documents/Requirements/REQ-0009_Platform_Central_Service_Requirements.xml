                <reqTitle>MedCommons needs an extensible command system for remote control of gateways</reqTitle>

            <requirement id="COMMAND-002">
                <reqTitle>There needs to be two command systems: one for gateway-to-gateway commands; one for application-level commands</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                </reqDescription>
            </requirement>
            <requirement id="COMMAND-003">
                <reqTitle>The command systems must not be user extensible; they can only be extended via configuration or software upgrades from MedCommons.</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                    The command systems are closed universes for the first versions of the system. This puts some boundaries on security and testing issues. This requirement may
                    be relaxed in a future version.

                <reqTitle>Command language must be capable of sequential operations</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                       On the application layer a sequence of commands might include the transfer of a CCR and the documents that it refers to

            <requirement id="COMMAND-009">
                <reqTitle>Commands must be communicated in a secure and authenticated manner.</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                    The MedCommons network is a closed network; commands can only come in from the central system or from an authenticated user. Third parties can not insert new commands
                    except through APIs controlled by MedCommons; gateways should not excecute commands unless they are from an authenticated source and can be checked for tampering
                    or corruption.
                </reqDescription>
            </requirement>

                <reqTitle>Commands must be cancellable by Central</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                    Commands must be able to be terminated by central. This may be because the gateway is hung or it may be  because the task that triggered these commands 
                    has itself been cancelled.
                </reqDescription>
            </requirement>
            <requirement id="COMMAND-011">
                <reqTitle>Execution of commands must be able to be monitored</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>The monitoring of commands is necessary for system support, debugging, and possibly both performance and security monitoring. The monitoring system
                has no requirement that the logs or traces be made permanent.
                </reqDescription>

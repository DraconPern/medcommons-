        <title>Overview</title>
   
        <para>
            The MedCommons applications and platform must be trusted by users if it is to be successful; it must earn and keep that trust over many years. The standard by which this is judged
            will change over time and we wish to lead the industry in this regard. Patients and doctors are trusting us with the transfer and storage of their private medical information. 
            
        </para>
        <para>
            No privacy or security system that has such a large social component is foolproof. Thus we need to detect problems and notify the appropriate party when a problem occurs. 
        </para>
        <para>
            Architectual decisions can attempt to minimize security issues (hard to guess identifiers; 
            avoiding storing data that we don't need to store; storing the bulk of data in encrypted form;  ). 
            Policies need to be defined for break-the-glass access; logging; 
        </para>

        <para>
            HIPAA requires that a risk analysis be performed 
        </para>
        <para>
            Risk analysis drives the MedCommons security architecture but it is only one part of the process. Regulations, good software security practice, and user interface design that 
            promotes good security hygiene are other important inputs. To the degree that these can be subsumed in risk analysis that's very useful.

            HIPAA.
            Privacy law
            
            The HIPAA requirements are not our requirements - they are input to our requirements as mediated by the risk analysis. The form and scope of the regulations is very broad; 
            MedCommons requirements narrow these down to what our business is responsible for in such a way that the requirements are concrete, clear, and testable.
            
            <para>
                Emphasize that these requirements are not contracts with external entities. For example- saying that x/y should not be possible is not binding with a customer. The various legal
                contracts are separate from these but it is hard to define documents that meet both sets of needs. Contracts need to be vetted by lawyers; these

            <title>General business stragegy</title>
            Volantary.  Assume we don't need contracts with each provider entity because we're under patient control. Prohibit (by architecture) random access of providers into patient's medical
            records. Don't provide back door APIs.

            <title>General Requirements</title>
            <requirement id="SEC-0001">
                <reqTitle>Security policies and application user interface must be understood by the user</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                    No system is secure if the users model is inconsistent with the policies and implementations. From a design perspective this is a big problem. 
                </reqDescription>
            </requirement>
            <requirement id="SEC-0002">
                <reqTitle>Security policies and application user interface must minimize security problems.</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>Phishing, various social engineering attempts to break security must be minimized by design. </reqDescription>
            </requirement>
            <requirement id="SEC-0003">
                <reqTitle>The MedCommons User must be in control over the security of their data.</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>There are some design tensions here between this requirement and SEC-0002. It is difficult to have general rules that prevent abuses in data sharing while permitting
                the user to define that they really do want to share their data with person X. How X gets authenticated; how to prevent others from impersonating X; how to keep this all simple at the same time
                is hard.
                </reqDescription>
            </requirement>
            <requirement id="SEC-0004">
                <reqTitle>Different components of the MedCommons system have different security requirements; the components with lower security requirements can not
                weaken the security of more secure components.
                </reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                    (I need terminology help here.The enterprise vs. respository vs. embedded gateway happens at the application layer, not here at the platform layer.)
                    Some portions are the MedCommons system are relatively insecure. For example - DICOM Query/Retrieve requires that inexact matches be performed on patient names. 
                    This type of component can not be as secure as the registry on the MedCommons central site.

            <para>
              Define privacy.
                Market-driven vs. ??
               
                When privacy has been breached (medical records are in court proceedings, theft, persons that were trusted are no longer trusted) the system must have a mechanism of
                denying further access.
                
                Reporting requirements. We need to define our business in such a way that we are not subject to medical reporting requirements (TB, sexually transmitted diseases). 
                This is the part of the
                'practice of medicine' that we need to avoid.

                <reqTitle>PHI availability in the MedCommons system is extremely restricted. PHI is only visible when a requirement specifies it to be available.</reqTitle>
                <reqDescription>
                    PHI (Patient Health Information) is confidential data that must not be disclosed to third parties. Instead of specifying where PHI can not be displayed the default 
                    in MedCommons shall be that PHI is not available.  Specifically:

                        <listitem>It is not possible to perform a query by patient name. All access to a patient's records follows the MedCommons User Id.</listitem>
                        <listitem>Transactions between system components should use only tracking numbers, data object identifiers, and gateway identifiers.
                            Even if someone could listen in on all transactions they would not be able to decipher PHI.</listitem>
                        <listitem>PHI within the MedCommons system should be stored in encrypted form.</listitem>

<big><big>Authorization Contexts</big></big><br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAN_DEFAULT</span> - A (DICOM)
Study object begins its MedCommons existence when it becomes available
to the Router via a DICOM transfer. At that point, the study has no
authorization context and is the HIPAA responsibility of whoever
controls the LAN that the DICOM came over on. At this point, MedCommons
has not modified the study in any way and may or may not have
acknowledged receipt (e.g.: DICOM Storage Commitment or IHE). As long
as MedCommons does not display the patient name or other Protected
Health Information (PHI) there's no HIPAA issue. Obviously MedCommons
tech support personnel may have access to PHI and, if they do, they
have to be trained in the procedures surrounding this responsibility.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAN_CLERICAL</span> - MedCommons
may be called upon to display PHI as part of an activity list or
worklist or as a result of a query. The typical LAN_CLERICAL context
might be the front desk clerk at an imaging center. This person would
be authorized to vew some or all of the recent activity on the Router
but may not be authorized to view images or reports. Their HIPAA
policies and training are the responsibility of whoever controls the
DICOM LAN. Occasionally, there may be some default restrictions placed
upon the LAN_CLERICAL context - e.g.: there are two imaging facilities
on the East and West sides of town and the clerk at each facility is
restricted, by default to one or the other. Even so, note that the
study has not been modified yet. <br>
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>If MedCommons displays PHI (E.G.: on it's Main Screen) in this
context, we will be expected to have a HIPAA Log entry that includes
Time/Date, Object ID, LAN ID and UserID. The Patient's approval is
implied and may have been documented in something they signed when they
agreed to the scan. In the rare situation where the Patient is being
scanned anonymously (e.g.: an HIV test or the patient is unidentified)
MedCommons should provide tools to identify a particular object without
relying on PHI. Even so, a HIPAA Log entry should be created.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAN_CLINICAL</span> - Typically,
this is the most common context. It allows full access by
technologists, physicians and nurses. This context also applies to the
default DICOM received and does not require any particular modification
of the study or associated information.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">PATIENT_ANY</span> - Here, the
patient has unequivocal and possibly sole access to the PHY (e.g.: the
equivalent of being imaged as John Doe and being handed the negatives
to take away). The patient, once they identify themselves somehow, take
full control of the study. For example, the patient might supply a
password or PKI certificate that is used to encrypt the study and all
PHI. Alternatively, a CD-ROM could be handed to the patient and all PHI
erased from the router. A LAN_CLERICAL or LAN_CLINICAL transaction may
precede PATIENT_ANY.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LICENSED_CLINICIAN</span> - This
is the most common "second opinion" context where an imaging facility
might try to limit its liability by insisting that PHI and images are
accessed only by a patient's physician. The facility that controls the
study will typically depend on the policies associed with the license
to limit its liability. For example, any physician with a valid license
and DEA number can prescribe narcotics. In this example, MedCommos
might be playing the role of pharmacy and be subject to HIPAA and
related regulations that control physician authentication and we, in
turn, may look to a third-party service (e.g.: Tracmed) to take that
responsibility.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">BUSINESS_ASSOCIATE</span> - This
is another common situation where MedCommons is used to move or copy a
study to another HIPAA-compliant facility such as a 3D processing
service. Business Associate is a HIPAA-defined category that is
separate from the Provider category. Business Associates have a
contractual relationship with the entity that controls the study. I'm
not sure whether MedCommons will need to keep separate contexts for
Business Associates vs. Providers (hospitals) but it can't hurt.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">EMERGENCY</span> - The specified
contexts&nbsp; where MedCommons might&nbsp; override other contexts.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NAMED_CLINICIAN</span> - An
alternative to LICENSED_CLINICIAN. Authentication might be via the USPS
and Authentidate.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED</span> -
This context might be assigned to a study that is being placed into
archival storage or simply to allow listing in a worklist at a remote
site. The controlling entity would insist that it be contacted before
release of the study. Encryption, may or may not be a component of the
implementation. If encryption is used, then we will have to deal with
back doors and key escrow issues.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">STRONG_AUTHENTICATION</span> -
This context could be applied to force users to be biometrically
authenticated or bonded in some way.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ROLE_SENSITIVE</span> - This can
of worms opens when authorization needs to depend on the recipient's
role. I'm not aware of any standard or legal definition of roles in
healthcare or HIPAA and things get even more complicated when patient's
family and health care proxies are involved. I'd like to stay away from
this if at all possible.<br>

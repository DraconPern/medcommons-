					<h2>Why GigStand?</h2>
		
			
				<p>GigStand is a digital musicstand for musicians and other performers. It lets you carry every bit of paper you've been schlepping to practices, sessions, and gigs in your iPhone or
				even better, in your iPad. It lets you and your bandmates share and exchange content and setlists in a controlled manner. GigStand works even when the Internet isn't available.

				<h3>Early Days</h3>
				<p>I went to a wedding a while back. The band was great. The bandleader had a dozen boxes of index cards with multiple parts scored out for thousands
				of tunes. These were not old guys, yet they were fiddling with paper like it was 1955</p>
				<p>A friend who plays in a jam band had to go to India for several months on business and I was asked to fill in 
				for the mostly weekly Grateful Dead/Bob Dylan jams they've been holding for years. When I walked into this setting I saw they all had extra large white 3 
				ring binders obscenely stuffed full of paper of all sorts.
				I couldn't imagine making a copy of this beast.</p>
				<p>Frankly, after a long career spent mostly in IT, I'd given up on the notion of purging paper from my life or anyone else's. 
				Maybe my grandkids won't have much use for it. But
				why not try to get rid of all this paper at least when it comes to Dylan and Co?</p>
				<p>This wasn't the prime motivator to actually do something, but it pushed me over the top.</p>
				<p>I've been playing in PlanB, a Classic Rock Cover Band for six or seven years now. Some of the guys have perfect memory and / or perfect pitch. I have neither.</p>
				<p>Without a book of crib sheets of various sorts I'd have been out on my ass. Our first go was always to some well known, ad-ridden websites which had
				the Top 500 tunes we needed.  After a while it became necessary to work on these tunes a bit, and get them printed and viewable in a decent form and without the very distracting ads.
				<p>So I collected a lot of paper, and a bunch of us shared our tune
				info via printed excel spreadsheets, and then finally, when the iPhone appeared, we made a website with single page renditions of all our tunes. </p>
				<p>This almost worked, except it seemed wherever we played the internet was very unreliable, 
				and there was a lot of embarrassment without power adapters and still there was a need for paper backup. </p>
				<p>And frankly, the  iPhone was a bit small for anyone over the age of 40 except in the case of emergencies. 
				By the time the iPad was announced, we were desperate for something we could actually use 
				and already had a strong set of requirements for GigStand</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Run Perfectly Even When Offline</li>
					<li>Make It Easy For BandMates to Share Tunes and Setlists</li>
					<li>Easy to See While Performing</li>
					<li>Easy to Control Even While Performing</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Our early efforts met none of these requirements. They were a hassle to use and somewhat dangerous.
				This is our second, or third effort.</p>

				<h2>Supported Input File Types</h2>
				
				<a href="#featured">Next</a>
				<h3>STL File Type</h3>
				<p>STL files are produced by GigStand as an email attachment to any SetList that is mailed by the user</p>
				<p>Any STL files in the iTunes Inbox are processed by GigStand and incorporated as additional GigStand SetLists</p>
				<p>Separate the STL attachment from the email body on your desktop or laptop and drag just the attachment into iTunes Sharing as detailed above</p>
				<h3>ZIP File Type</h3>
				<p>Prepare all your content on your desktop or laptop system before connecting your mobile device. Each incoming ZIP file maps directly to one GigStand Archive</p>
				<h4>Special Files in the ZIP</h4>
				<p>These files are optional, but if present, make the ZIP file more useful for the end user</p>
				<h5>Logo File</h5>
				<p>If a file named --logo--.jpeg, --logo--.jpg, --logo--.png, or --logo--.gif is present in the zip file, it is used as the logo for the archive in GigStand.
				
				<h5>Header Markup File</h5>
				<p>If a file named --header--.html is present, it is incorporated into the html headers of all html files in the zip file</p>
				<h5>Info File</h5>
				<p>If a file named --info--.html is present, it is display when information about the archive is requested. It will typically contain attribution back to the original
				content source</p>
				<h4>Filename Processing</h4>
				<p>Individual files are handled differently based on the ZIP file name, and potentially, the name of the tune itself.</p>

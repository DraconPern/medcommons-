Read Me for Sample CCRs Folders

This folder is used to store sample CCRs generated by vendors to check for issues around compatibility.  Please add a folder with the name of your company and place your CCR files in that folder.  Then others can download those files and try them out.

Naming Conventions for those files:
ccrsample_[vendorname]_[date].xml

Example:
-------------
ccrsample_aafp_20050918.xml

-------------

Also make sure to add an <Actor> for your Information System that created the CCR and add an <ActorLink> in the <From>

Example:
----------------------------
<Actor>Ê <ActorObjectID>AA0004</ActorObjectID>    <InformationSystem>     <Name>Solventus CCR Generation Tool</Name>      <Version>V1.0</Version> Ê </InformationSystem> <Source>  <Actor>    <ActorID>AA0002</ActorID> Ê </Actor> </Source></Actor>

CCR XSLT Change Log

Changes in version 1.2.1 (20060420)
=================================
- fixed the error in FamilyProblemHistory, "a:Problem" was in the XPath expressions for the
	Description/Text and Description/Code and it needed to be removed
- changed the default Table stlyes (classes: list and internal) to be top vertically aligned
- add xsl:if states in Patient's and Actor's Address so empty ',' and ':' will not be displayed
- fixed actor.xsl to display Information/Type.  The XPath expression was missing the
	"a:InformationSystem/"
- added xsl:if statement in displaying the "To" so if there is no ActorRole, there are no "()"
- removed empty columns before CCR header information and patient demographics that cause FireFox
	to display those row off to the right.
- changed Actors header to "Additional Information About People & Organizations"

Changes in version 1.2
=================================
- fixed "Email" typo so the EMail will display in actors
- fixed IDs/ID iteration.  The IDs for actors will now display multiple ID elements
- added a parameter to allow a differnt CSS to be passed to the XSLT
- comparmentalized the large XSLT into smaller templates
	- the subfolder 'lib' contains the EXSLT libraries
	- the subfolder 'templates' contains subtemplates called by the top XSLT
- added a footer.xsl file
- added a defaulCSS.xsl which contains the text for the default CSS
- added a code.xsl file which contains the template for CodeType
- moved actor templates into a separate file
- moved datatime template into a separate file
- moved Problem/Description template into a separate file
- added a directions.xsl which contain the template to display Directions
	- add a xsl:choose statement to display the Direction/Description/Text node contents
	  if present, otherwise it constructs the SIG from the structured data.
- added 'id' attributes to each table and to the <tr> above each section header.
	Thanks to Simon from Medcommons for adding these 'id' attributes. This will make
	it easier to navigate within the HTML file, if needed.

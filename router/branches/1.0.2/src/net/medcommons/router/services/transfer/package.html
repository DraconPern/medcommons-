This package is completely temporary. It is some scaffolding to get the purple 
boxes off the ground.

For example: the routing queue and routing queue status items will exist on
the pink boxes. The order may as well (if the order contains a CCR perhaps
the CCR will be on the purple boxes and the index to them (the database) on
the pink boxes.

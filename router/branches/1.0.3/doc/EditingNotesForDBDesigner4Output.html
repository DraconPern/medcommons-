      <title>Notes for editing generated SQL from DBDesigner 4 for use in Derby</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>
      The SQL output of DBDesigner4 isn't directly usable by Derby; apparently it works well with
      MySQL. After generation of the SQL the following steps are required so that it can be inserted into 
      the Derber <i>ij</i> utility.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
							<li>Replace " NOT NULL," with ","</li>
							<li>Replace " NULL," with ","</li>
							<li>Replace "UNSIGNED" with ""</li>
							<li>Replace " ," with ","</li>
							<li>
							Edit trailing commas out for each table on last row:
							<pre>
 CREATE TABLE DocumentLocation (
  Documents_GUID VARCHAR(64),
  Nodes_NodeID BIGINT,
  IntegrityCheck TIMESTAMP,
  IntegrityStatus INTEGER,
);

							</pre>
							becomes (see IntegrityStatus row)

							<pre>
CREATE TABLE DocumentLocation (
  Documents_GUID VARCHAR(64),
  Nodes_NodeID BIGINT,
  IntegrityCheck TIMESTAMP,
  IntegrityStatus INTEGER
);
							
							</pre>
							</li>
	</ol>
      

<p>
Also, note that the type BOOL  doesn't appear to be supported.

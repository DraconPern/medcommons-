PatientID is constructed as:

<vendor-code>-<id>^^^&1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.2005.1.1&ISO^PI

but remember that & is a special character in XML so it must be escaped.  When submitting metadata
escape the & as follows:

<vendor-code>-<id>^^^&amp;1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.2005.1.1&amp;ISO^PI

When constructing a query, esacpe the & as follows:

<vendor-code>-<id>^^^&amp;amp;1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.2005.1.1&amp;amp;ISO^PI

where
<vendor-code> comes from the above vendor table
<id> is a private ID assigned by the vendor to be used in testing
1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.2005.1.1 is the OID assigned as identifying the affinity domain to be used for this 
    year's connectathon.

The inclusion of the private ID enables vendors to generate private test data in the 
NIST Registry to support their testing.

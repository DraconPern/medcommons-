<h1>General goals</h1>

      
<ul>
        
<li>
          Provide a simple unit testing framework focused on server side java 
          code which tries to cover all J2EE component models and potentially
          other type of components.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Allow fine-grained continuous testing of all files making up  
          an application: source code but also meta-data files (such as 
          deployment descriptors, etc) through an in-container approach. 
          Integration work is costly and Cactus tries to spread this load
          by doing it during development in an automated way.
        </li>
      
</ul>          
        
    
</div>

    
<div class="section">
<h1>Medium terms goals and ideas</h1>

      
<p>
        The short term goals for Cactus are to continue providing and improving
        support for J2EE unit testing. More specifically the following areas
        are being considered and researched:
      </p>
        
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          Add support for Servlet API 2.4/JSP 2.0 (by using 
          Tomcat 5/Resin 3.x),
        </li>
        
<li>
          Provide a full servlet container test suite a la Watchdog using Cactus.,
        </li>
        
<li>
          Performance unit testing: Add performance extensions to be able to 
          test each single method in performance.
        </li>
        
<li>
          More tutorial on AspectJ testing. Potentially add a Cactus Aspect 
          extension to allow writing test cases as Aspects (this may allow to
          remove the need for Cactus redirectors).
        </li>
        
<li>
          Add EJB Redirectors to be able to unit test Session Beans, Entity 
          Beans and MessageDriven Beans          
        </li>
        
<li>
          Decouple the Cactus framework into the core and its "plugins". This 
          means to publish a public API and a public SPI. The SPI would allow
          to support plugin for testing different type of components (Servlet,
          Entity EJB, Struts Actions, etc).
        </li>
      
</ul>

<h1>Long term vision</h1>

      
<div class="section">
<h2>The Future of Component Unit Testing</h2>

        
<p>
          We believe unit testing server side components is going to get harder
          and harder in the future, unless something is done about it!
          Even now, depending on the specifications
          for a given component model it is more or less easy. Sometimes it is
          even not feasible to test all kind of code.
        </p>
        
<p>
          We believe that we will see more and more components in the future.
          By components we mean pieces of code that execute in a container.
          The container will provide more and more services for the components
          (like transactions, security, life cycle, persistence, interfaces
          - like web services -, logging, ...). The consequences will be:
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
            testing strategies that are not in-container, like Mock Objects
            will still very useful but will provide less added value in
            ensuring that the code behaves ok. Indeed, as the components will
            rely more and more on the container's services, the confidence that
            the tests will run well when deployed will decrease and the need
            for a solution that ensures the code will run correctly in its
            environment will increase,
          </li>
          
<li>
            it will become more and more difficult to offer an in-container
            unit testing framework that lives outside the container.
          </li>
        
</ul>

      
</div>

      
<div class="section">
<h2>Long term goals for Cactus</h2>

        
<p>
          Consequently to the above predictions, there are 2 long term goals
          for Cactus:
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
            Continue with the in-container approach as much as possible. It is
            a best try effort in order to provide tests in which you can have
            a good confidence,
          </li>
          
<li>
            However, we believe the only satisfactory and long term solution 
            is to include (unit) testing APIs as <i>part</i> of the container
            specifications. This could be done in the form of a SPI 
            (Service Provider Interface) against which a generic unit testing 
            framework could be plugged, thus leaving the implementation details
            to an external framework and only providing maybe a generic
            and simple implementation. Thus, one goal of Cactus is to help
            specify needed container API/SPI for unit testing, 
            i.e. create
            an additional service of the container:  a "unit-testing service"
            (in addition to the existing Security, Transaction, Life Cycle, ...
            Services). The ultimate
            goal will be reached when this new API/SPI is accepted and become
            a de jure standard. It would then be time to think about 
            integrating it into the Servlet Specifications 
            (or other components -like EJBs -
            specifications). Agreed, this far-streched at the current time
            but it is the Cactus vision!

<h1>Introduction</h1>

    
<p>
      The Cactus Project is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" title="">Open Source</a>
      volunteer project under the auspices of the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/" title="">Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a>,
      and, in harmony with the Apache webserver itself, it is released under
      a very open license.
      This means there are many ways to contribute to the project
      (coding, documenting, answering questions,
      proposing ideas, reporting bugs, suggesting bug-fixes, etc..).
    </p>
    
<p>
      To begin with, we suggest you to subscribe to the 
      <a href=".././mailinglist.html" title="Information about the Cactus mailing lists.">Cactus mailing list</a>.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Then you can download the <a href=".././downloads.html" title="Downloads of Cactus releases and nightly builds.">latest Cactus
      release</a> or checkout the latest code from
      <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta/cactus/trunk/" title="">SVN</a>.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Last, you can check the <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CACTUS?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:openissues-panel" title="">todo list</a> and 
      jump in.
    </p>

<div class="section">
<h1>Help Wanted Here</h1>

    
<p>
      The rest of this document is mainly about
      contributing new or improved code and/or documentation, but we would also
      be glad to have extra help in any of the following areas:
    </p>
    
<ul>
      
<li>
        Answering questions on the 
        <a href=".././mailinglist.html" title="Information about the Cactus mailing lists.">Cactus mailing list</a>;
        there is often a problem of having too many questioners and not enough
        experts to respond to all the questions.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Testing Cactus (especially its less-frequently-used features) on
        various configurations and reporting back.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Debugging - producing reproducable test cases and/or finding causes of
        bugs (bugs can be found in the
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10471" title="">bug database</a>).
      </li>
      
<li>
        Specifying/analysing/designing new features for Cactus (If you wish to
        get involved with this, please join the <a href=".././mailinglist.html" title="Information about the Cactus mailing lists.">
        Cactus mailing list</a>,
        install and try out Cactus and read some of the mailing list archives.
        In addition, please have a look at the 
        <a href=".././goals.html" title="Short and long term goals for Cactus.">Goals</a> page which gives a vision of 
        where Cactus is heading and provide some high level todos.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Providing automated Ant scripts for new servlet engines/application
        servers. The list of supported servers can found in the
        <a href=".././features.html" title="Cactus feature list.">features</a> list.
      </li>
      
<li>
        ... and there is just one other thing - don't forget to tell everyone
        who asks how great Cactus is! ;-)
        The more people that know about and start to use Cactus, the larger the
        pool of potential contributors there will be.
      </li>
    
</ul>
 
    
<p>
      Thank you very much.
    </p>

<h1>Contributions of Code and Documentation</h1>
  
    
<p>
      We are starting to use an informal system for accepting contributions to
      Cactus. The process varies depending on whether the contribution is a
      modification (i.e. patch) or a fairly standalone item, and whether you 
      have commit access (committers have been granted access by a vote of 
      confidence, so they are assumed to be trustworthy enough
      to make changes directly in SVN. If you submit many good patches, you
      may be nominated as a committer yourself!)
    </p>

    
<p>
      If your contribution requires changing more than a few lines of Cactus
      (code or documentation), then it counts as a <b>patch</b>. If 
      you have a patch and would like to see it incorporated into the Cactus
      distribution, take note of the Licensing Requirements listed below, and 
      then create a <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10471" title="">JIRA issue</a> and attach
      to it a unified diff (<code>svn diff</code>) of your changes against
      the latest SVN version of the code (SVN trunk).
    </p>
  
    
<div class="section">
<h2>Licensing Requirements for the Cactus Distribution</h2>
  
      
<p>
        To avoid legal problems, the Apache Project Management Committee (PMC) 
        have agreed on a policy for under what licensing code can be accepted 
        into Apache projects:
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          Source code files must be under the Apache license and must have
          copyright assigned to the Apache Software Foundation.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Jar files need only be released under a license that permits free 
          redistribution and does not cover new files added to the jar/library
          (so the GPL and LGPL are not allowed, but MPL and Apache licenses are,
          for example).
        </li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>
        
<b>By submitting a patch, you signify your understanding and 
        acceptance of these conditions</b> - like most open source projects
        , we do not have the resources nor the inclination to obtain signed 
        statements from all contributors!

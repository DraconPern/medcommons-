The Cactus project is pleased to announce the release of version 1.7.2.
Cactus is a unit testing framework for testing server side java code.

Goals
-----

This release was created just because the previous 1.7.x releases bundled an LGPL jar (jboss-j2ee.jar, necessary to run the samples), which is not alloweb by ASF policies.
Other than that, the only technical change is a new feature on the Maven plugin (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CACTUS-231).


Main new features
-----------------

- Cactus now uses Cargo for the CactifyEar task
- JDK 1.2 and 1.3 are no longer supported

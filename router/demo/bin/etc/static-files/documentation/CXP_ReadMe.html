      <h1>CXP ReadMe</h1>
      
      This file has a few links to CXP related resources. 
      
      <h2>CXP Protocol</h2>
      The latest version of the <a href="CXP_Protocol_Specification.pdf">CXP Protocol Specification</a> is slightly out of date and will be upgraded in the next few days.
      <h2>MedCommons CXP FireFox Client</h2>
      The most recent version of the FireFox client is 
      <a href="http://www.medcommons.net/ccr_client/1.21/xpi_warning.htmi">mccxp_0.9.21.xp</a>.
      Click on this link to install in FireFox, then restart FireFox. If your browser security settings won't let you install from this link then right-click on the link to 'Save Link As' to the local file system. Once there simply load the installer using the 'Open File' menu.
      
      <h2>Sample CXP SOAP client</h2>
      The source for a  trivial (and completely functional) CXP SOAP client is 
      <a href="SimpleCXPClient.java">here</a>. All other files needed to compile or run this program are 
      available by downloading <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Apache Axis</a>, <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces 2.7.1</a> and other standard Java tools
      like javac and ant. Please contact Sean Doyle with any questions about this code or discuss it on the CCR Accel mailing list.
      
      <h2>WSDL</h2>
      The <a href="/router/services/CCRServiceSoap?wsdl">current WSDL</a> for the CXP server is available on all gateway machines. This is derived from the <a href="CCR_RR_Original.wsdl">WSDL</a>   provided by Roberto Ruggeri from Microsoft (Roberto.Ruggeri@microsoft.com).
     
     <h2>Validation XSD</h2>
     The current schema file used for CCR validation is <a href="CCR_20051109.xsd">CCR_20051107.xsd</a>.

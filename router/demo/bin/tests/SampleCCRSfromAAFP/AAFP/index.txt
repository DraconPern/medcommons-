sampleCCR.xml
-------------
This file validates with the latest XSD (still need to check against the latest implmentation guide)

sampleCCR_v2.xml
-------------
This is a modification of sampleCCR.xml that contains <Insurance> data.  I have a question in to the CCR authors about the cardinality of <IDs>.  In the XSD it is 0..1, but the implementation guide is written as 0...unbound.

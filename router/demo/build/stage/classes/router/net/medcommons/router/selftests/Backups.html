<ul>
    <li>This test relies on the <a href='/acct/testdata.php' target='_new'>Base Test Data</a> being created. 
        Make sure the test data scripts have been run.</li>
    <li>This test exercises the connection to S3.  Check that S3 credentials are correct in the console.</li>
    <li>Check that the console configuration has been published.</li>
    <li>Check that S3 credentials have been successfully published to /opt/gateway/conf/LocalBootParameters.properties</li>
    <li>You may need to restart the gateway if you have published new S3 credentials.</li>
    <li>It is possible this test may fail if the backup is very slow to occur (takes more than 6 seconds).
        Try the test again, or look at the <a href='status.do'>Gateway Status Page</a> to see 
        what the current backup latency is.  If this occurs persistently you can increase the time
        that is allowed for backups to occur in this test by adjusting the configuration parameter
        "BackupsSelfTestWaitTimeMs" in the LocalBootParameters.properties file.</li>

CHANGES FOR V1.4b (patch) -----------------------
Distributed 7 Dec 2004


Updated patientId.txt to reflect current knowledge of how to encode & characters 
in XML and more specifically the special encoding needed when using the 
utility xdstest.

Cleaned up names in example metadata. Effected entries are XdsDocumentEntry.patientId and
XdsDocumentEntry.uniqueId. Change is cosmetic only. Updated 
metadata_validation/validateNN.xsl (metadata analyser) to match these name changes.

Documentation for the Java source code for the test client is out of date with respect to the 
directory structure of the test kit.  It has been fixed.
Files changed: doc/clientCode.doc  doc/install.doc

CHANGES FOR V1.4a (patch) -----------------------
Distributed 6 Dec 2004

Bug in Metadata Validator.  Error message indicates Content Type Code is missing on 
a document.  Content Type Code is an attribute of a Submission Set and not a document.
The wording of the message has been corrected.
Files affected: metadata_validation/validateNN.xsl

CHANGES FOR V1.4 ------------------------
Distributed 2 Dec 2004

The metadata validator transform has been updated. It now runs on Microsoft platforms.

doc/XDS Tests.doc requires the following update
In the following documentation, the NIST Test Server is referred to as:
	<NISTTestServer>
In all cases replace <NISTTestServer> with 
	http://www.hcxw2k1.nist.gov:8080/xdsServices/
The port number was left off.

Tests 11781 and 11782 is ready for testing (Document Consumer)

Fixed error in doc/Metadata Cookbook.doc - in the section Adding a Document to a
Submission Set, the association was missing that linked the ExtrinsicObject to
the RegistryPackage. It has been added.

Added new file to test kit, patientIds.txt which describes how to generate patient IDs that
are private to one vendor.  This is to be used to support vendor's need to generate test data
for their XDS based applications.

Corrected format of Content-ID header field inside a multipart-mime (RFC2387 (multipart/related), RFC2045 (MIME) and RFC2046 (MIME
parts)). Correct format is
Content-ID: <id>
The angle brackets had been left off.  This effects the following files and tests:
sampleData/RepSubmitReq.txt
test/11746/test.properties
test/11752/test.properties


CHANGES FOR V1.3 ------------------------
Distributed 23 Nov 2004

The name of two coding schemes were corrected so that all coding scheme names end in a
plural - effects Connect-a-thon classCodes and Connect-a-thon contentTypeCodes and tests 
11722, 11731, 11746, and 11752

Cleaned up server coding regarding the parsing of metadata vs attachments in hope of fixing problem
with test 11746

codes/mimeTypes.xml now has same format as other codes files with name and value attributes.

Updated time format from 20041225T21:20:10 to CCYYMMDDHHmmSS per discussion on mailing list. Change
proposal to profile pending.

Test 11710 - updated format of metadata.xml, to make generating XML easier. The older version with "caller" element will still work.

The file doc/XDS Tests.doc has been renamed to doc/XDSNistTest.doc

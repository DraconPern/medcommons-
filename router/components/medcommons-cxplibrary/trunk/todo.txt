Remove xfire dependencies from other places; here's where the version is set.

Build transfer app based on the client.

get org.astm files here.
generate?
Get ddl subset of signed jar files.
Perhaps create jars with signed contents with different names in ivy. 
Instead of version "1.2.3" it would be "mc_signed1.2.3"
Check ddl names
